		<p>What the osfork? Just like the pythonic way of spawning off different processes by invoking <p style="font-family:courier;">os.fork</p>, this website is meant to have different processes of content.</p>
		<p>From technical stuff, to books I've read, and ramblings about life, all my thought processes are here.</p>

    <p>How do you stay motivated in life? It constantly berates you, constantly throws repulsive things at you. Occasionally it gives you a flower and a lovely sight, but most of the time, believe me you, you'll be in a shit hole. So how does one stay positive in such a situation?</p>
<p>Well here are a few things we know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Life's a bitch.</li>
<li>You're a motherfucking badass.</li>
<li>Badasses don't take shit from a bitch.</li>
<li>Badasses fuck bitches up.</li>
</ol>
<p>Yes, we fuck shit up.</p>
<p><img alt="dfdcc5ac07ad9de7f5c5f360e878ae330d83b52a7d10b99f120211f8738a51e3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-307" height="330" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/dfdcc5ac07ad9de7f5c5f360e878ae330d83b52a7d10b99f120211f8738a51e3.jpg" width="440"></p>
<p>So, now we have our actions on what badasses like us do, lets revisit our predicament again: <strong>We're in a shit hole called life.</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to succeed in life, and entirely up to luck. Given the current world population and wealth distribution, you're statistically more likely to be born in a place where you're almost going to fail (as defined from a purely societal construct). So how do we fuck this plan life has for us? A plan for suffering and failure, a plan for destitute and agony? Simple: We point our middle fingers at it, and proceed to <strong>Succeed the shit out of life </strong> like the rebels we are.</p>
<p>Anarchy!</p>
<p>Chaos!</p>
<p>Life's plan is so hard, it's so easy and normal to just fail. We accept failure. We're told to accept failure. Fuck that. Succeed at all cost. (within legal and moral limits). Fuck life up not by drugs. Doing drugs is easy. Fuck life up by succeeding, because that's life on hard mode.</p>
