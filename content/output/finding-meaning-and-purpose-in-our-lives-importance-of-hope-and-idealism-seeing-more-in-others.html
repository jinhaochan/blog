<p>I find this video holding a lot of truth to it. It says that if we see someone for who they actually are, we are not doing justice to them. We are taking them merely at face value, which holds very little information or moral description. If we take someone only for who they are, be it physically or merely by their occupation, we are overlooking the vast complexity of thoughts and potentials in their life. That is to say, if i told you i am a student, and you proceed to form judgements and perspectives solely based on that fact, it would do me absolutely no justice. Like the plane, if we only look straight ahead for who a person is, we will end up reaching a low level of conclusion.</p>
<p>We must therefore take people for more than who they are, more than what we see in them. If we see a student, we must look deeper and appreciate their complexity of life and thoughts. When we do that, we will see who they really are, just like reaching the destination if we look higher to compensate for the crosswinds.</p>
<p>This can be said to be not judging a book by its cover, but i think that it covers a broader area which says that, we must proactively assume people to be of a higher value. Once we someone to be greater, it automatically diffuses into their subconscious, and they will feel confident about their skills and character, thus making it a self fulfilling prophecy. If we constantly put someone down and look lowly of them, it will eat away at their soul, making them regress deeper into your negative views.</p>
<p>In short; everyone around you is a teacher and greater than what you percieve, and you should make it known to them. (But caution not to make it excessive flattery)</p>
