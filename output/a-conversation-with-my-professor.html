Below is the email conversation between me and professor regard the realism and non-realism view on religion. Realism views that a person who subscribes to religion attributes his faith solely in a divine being, while non-realism attributes it to human experiences and human feelings that they would search for a religion. I for one hold the non-realism view on religion. I thought it was interesting so I'm sharing it.



<div dir="ltr">

 



<div dir="ltr">

*Good day Professor Andres,*
<div>

* *



<div>

*It was an interesting discussion we had today in the Faith and Reason seminar, although slightly more dense and harder to grasp then the previous seminar.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*I would like to extend the discussion on realism and non-realism school of thoughts as it strikes deeply with me and is the possible reason why I am in this course.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*I hold the non-realism view on religion and would attribute all religious persuasions to purely human experience, and that also religion is a product of human conciousness. *



<div>

* *



<div>

*I draw reference to Daniel C. Dennett's essay "An Evolutionary Account of Religion", in which he states in the section "The Roots of Religion" last paragraph, that "At the root of human belief in gods lies an instinct on hair trigger: the disposition to attribute agency - beliefs and desires and other mental states - to anything complicated that moves ...". Here, I would think that the subject matter would be anything complicated, and that would encompass human consciousness, human anatomy, works of nature etc. Thus, it is because we as humans with our limited knowledge cannot comprehend the entire mechanics of the cosmos, and it being complicated, we therefore attribute some form of agency to it, which is God.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*In an argument made by Leonard Mlodinow in the book "Is God an Illusion?", it is argued that when Reductionist reaches a certain point in which they can no longer find any plausible explanations, religion takes the opportunity to step in. An example would be the breaking down of the atom to protons, to quarks, to gluons and finally to strings. When science is unable to explain what happens at the string level (aside from the unproven string theory), religion is then quick to fill in the shoes and explain this phenomenon through supernatural means.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*I thus propose that it is human experiences, be it the dissatisfaction in the inability to explain a complex system through logical means, or the feeling of fear of death and uncertainty, that would lead us to seek answers that science cannot explain, and religion insofar provides some of the "best" explanations. Religion is able to quell these uncertainties and fears by providing religious explanations, and since science cannot disprove it, it is mostly accepted. In fact, as an atheist who subscribes to Humanistic Naturalism, we too have a set of beliefs to quell these fears and uncertainties, just that in doing so, we employ a non-supernatural approach (drawing instead from human values, knowledge and morality). Thus being a Naturalist is no different as being a Christian, even if they both provide radically different teachings, as both provides a common sense of comfort and suppresses the fear and uncertainty that science and reason cannot explain. It is at essence human experiences that drives us to seek answers, and this leads us to accept different teachings.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*Also, in the class we had this problem with the non-realist view, as a person (Agnes, in our class) was willing to give up her religion if and only if Christianity was proven to be undoubtedly wrong. However, I would argue that since Christianity is simply an outlet for quelling human fears/uncertainties (something which I find possible with Naturalism as well), if she were to give up Christianity, she would then find another school of teaching that has not yet been proven false to answer her questions and doubts. Since at its rudimentary level it is driven by human experiences, religion is only one of the possible cures for our existential ailments. Non-religious approaches can also be employed to tackle this problem, as evident from the growing number of atheist in the world (Third biggest "religion" just behind Christianity and Islam <http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250096/You-wouldnt-believe-atheism-worlds-biggest-faith-Christianity-Islam.html>).*



<div>

* *



<div>

*Finally, we also had one problem on non-realism that the believe in God extends beyond human experiences. I would argue that once a person is satisfied with an answer religion provides in one area, they subscribe to it entirely (and not cherry-pick). I would then refer to the essay "Thinking About God" in the section "What is Philosophy on Religion?" where it mentions implications, and that "... if a person believes x, what other beliefs must she logically accept, whether she realizes it or not?". Thus for the case of Agnes, if she believes and accepts the answers that Christianity provides for her mortal dilemmas (x), she must then implicitly accept that God exists in order to provide the answers (y), and further accept God's historical account that stretches beyond the manifestation of human conciousness back to before the Big Bang(z). Thus through the concepts of implications we can solve this issue.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*In simple conclusion, I believe in the non-realist view on religion, and that all religious devotions and convictions can be traced back to a fundamental human experience fuelling it. Fear would be the most common human feeling which would persuade one to subscribe to religion.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*Apologies for the long letter and I appreciate your time spent in reading and trying to make sense of my argument (if any). I would wholeheartedly accept any counter arguments you provide and study them with due diligence.*

*Dear Jin Hao, *
<div>

* *



<div>

*These are very thoughtful comments. I love it! *



<div>

* *



<div>

*I would encourage you to review the distinction between religious realism and religious nonrealism. The difference between the two views is not that religious nonrealism says religious beliefs are "products of human consciousness," while realism denies this. The two views conflict over the question of what religious beliefs are about. Religious realists think that religious beliefs are, in part, about an independently existing supernatural reality. Religious nonrealists deny this, and insist that religious beliefs are only about human experience.*



<div>

* *



<div>

*Agnes said that she would abandon her faith if it were proven that there is no supernatural being called 'God' who pre-existed humankind, who created the universe, and who is all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good. She said that she would abandon her faith, because she sincerely believes that this supernatural being exists, and if it turned out that God didn't exist, she would have no reason to continue believing in God. This suggests that Agnes's belief in God is really about an independently existing supernatural being, and not just about her experience. If Agnes's belief were really just about her own human experience, then her reason for having that belief wouldn't be extinguished by the discovery that God doesn't exist; instead her reason for believing in God would remain intact, provided that the belief continued to relate to her experience in the right way. *



<div>

* *



<div>

*You may be right that if Agnes did one day abandon her belief in God, she would adopt a different set of beliefs to relieve her "existential ailments." But that doesn't show that her belief in God wasn't about a supernatural entity: the belief could serve the function of alleviating her existential ailments, while at the same time being about a supernatural entity. This is entirely compatible with religious realism. *



<div>

* *



<div>

*Like you, I think some hypothesis similar to Dennett's explanation of why people have religious beliefs is probably correct. This explanation is compatible with religious realism. I think religious nonrealism confuses the causes of a belief and the content of that belief. Experiences of dependence and vulnerability may cause a person to believe in God. But the content of that belief is something else--the content of the belief in God is WHAT is believed. And as Agnes freely told us, WHAT she believes is that there exists a supernatural entity called 'God.' The difference between the cause of a belief and its content is brilliantly explained by Roger Trigg in his "Defense of Religious Realism." *



<div>

* *



<div>

*Incidentally, the survey you mentioned doesn't say that atheism is the third largest "faith." Rather, the category is people who have no religious affiliation. They may include atheists, agnostics, people who have no opinion on spiritual matters, and people who have spiritual beliefs (like a belief in God) but don't identify themselves as members of any established religion. *



<div>

* *



<div>

*On another topic, I disagree that human values, knowledge, and morality cannot be explained by reason and science. I think science is part of our knowledge, and a product of our capacity for reason. Knowledge of values and morality can also be attained through reason. *



<div>

* *



<div>

*Moreover, I even think questions of morality can be answered through scientific analysis. If you wish to watch it, here is a nice TED talk by Sam Harris that defends a view very similar to mine: <http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html> *

*Thanks for your note, I enjoyed reading it very much.*
