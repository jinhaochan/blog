  <div>
    <p>During my course of security research work, I came across this concept of web beacons, which is a clever way of knowing who has opened up a document.</p>
<p>A Web Beacon is an element inside the document, that is not a saved resource. Rather, the element sends a request out to a server to retrieve the resource. An example of this would be an image tag, that requests the image resource from a server.</p>
<p>For example, writing this piece of code fetches the image resource from www.w3schools.com server:</p>
<p><code>img src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg" alt="W3Schools.com" style="width:104px;height:142px;"</code></p>
<!-- wp:image {"align":"center"} -->

<p><img alt="W3Schools.com" src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/w3schools_green.jpg"><br>
<figcaption>
Image retrieved from w3 schools
</figcaption></p>
<p>It's a very simple concept, and we can make use of this functionality and twist it to be a defensive tool</p>
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h3>Web Server Request Tracking</h3>
<hr>
<p>If we can setup our own server that hosts resources, we can secretly embed invisible images, or elements that makes requests to our servers to retrieve those resources.</p>
<p>This way, when the document is opened, the tries to render itself by making a request to our server for the resource. It acts as a tripwire that immediately triggers the moment the document is opened. And as the image is is not obvious to the threat actor, he would not be aware of this callback.</p>
<!-- wp:heading {"level":3} -->

<h3>Improvements?</h3>
<hr>
<p>The obvious drawback to this is that, once the document is taken to an offline premise, the image can no longer make a request to our server. This means that we will not be notified when the tripwire is activated.</p>
<p>The second drawback is: So what?</p>
<p>So what if I know if the document has been opened by some unauthorized person, or in another location? What can I do to prevent him from opening it? Some simple solutions that I came up with are:</p>
<p>If the requesting IP address is not in the whitelist, we return an extremely huge image, hopefully to make the document hang and not be usable.</p>
<p>Another improvement is, aside from image resources, what other resources can be requested, and hopefully such resources can be "executed". Of course, such a solution is considered intrusive, because then it can be used in malicious ways for remote code execution.</p>
