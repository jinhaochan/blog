The world is absolutely relative. Kind of an oxymoron, but absolutely true. We find no worth in things, unless it is relative to something else. There needs to be a comparison to show the contrast, to show the greater value over something. Relativity thus requires at least one object in comparison to be the "losing" one in someway or another.

If we have an abundance of something, with nothing to compare it to, the value will no longer be recognized. It can no longer stand out amongst the mass of substandard goods, and we hold no relativistic value to it. With that in mind, we as humans also hold a certain value. Although it is morally questionable to put down one humans value relative to another, it is done all the time. And in many cases, it is ourselves who perform this relative value assessment through introspection.

To us, our worth is measured, broadly classified, in four areas:

1\) Professional  
2) Social  
3) Spiritual  
4) Romance

The intersection of these 4 areas collectively leads to the 5th element which we humans value so much: Self-esteem. We hold certain beliefs about ourselves, how good we are, how much we're worth, and how valuable we are to people. But these measurements mean absolutely nothing if measure alone. Without relative measurements of skills, social connections and love, we will never know where we stand, or how good is our good. Therefore, our self-esteem is also measured relativistically with other people.

We always seem to be caught in comparison with someone else, and that gives us a certain goal we will work towards. We compare ourselves with the rich, and strive towards their statuses. We compare ourselves with the smart, and work towards their intelligence. We compare ourselves to the less fortunate, and become satisfied with our current situation. But more often than not, we find ourselves unhappy when comparing against others. Even once we reach the desired status, we feel the need to compare ourselves with another higher goal to validate ourselves. It then becomes a never ending cycle of comparison.

There are millions of people out there we can compare ourselves to, and we have to realize that comparing and competing with others is inherently toxic. It brings us only temporary joy when we equal or best our reference. It gives us a fleeting moment of bliss, but it quickly disappears and gets consumed by another person to compare with. We become unable to reach a satiated state, but forever trapped in the carrot-chasing limbo of achieving something. Comparison can be healthy in some ways. It motivates us to do something about ourselves, but when there no end in sight, we must break out of the cycle. We must first compare with ourselves.

Instead of competing and looking outward towards the world and their achievements, we should first recognize our own achievements, and set to overcome them. We should view our past selves as separate entities to defeat and to overcome, and every day is an opportunity to do so.

Physically: Become stronger, healthier and more active. Take care of your body. Eat right, sleep right and be productive in your movements.  
Mentally: Become smarter. Become knowledgable. Read areas you have never heard of before. Real about the world and it's history. Read about the great people and learn from them.  
Socially: Make more friends. Talk to strangers. Be able to express yourself and your ideas. Reach out to people who need help. Connect with old friends, revitalize existing ones.

There are so many more realms we can cover, and it is up to you to decide which part of you that you wish to overcome. Do not be intimidated by others, for they are not you, nor you they. look inwards. There you will find the most important questions, and only you can come up with the most relevant answers.
