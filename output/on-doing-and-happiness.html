    <p>I wrote some post a while back that explored what I felt that I should do, and to some extent, embarking on my passion hunt.</p>
<p>I now feel that passion should not be tied down to one specific action. Be it a passion for sports, or drawing, or technology. Passion should be about life and living. We weren't born to paint, or to play basketball. We were born to live, and what we do with the life we live makes it worth while.</p>
<p>Whatever makes you happy, you should pursue it. Don't be troubled that multiple things make you happy, and that you're a Jack of all trades, master of none. It's okay to want to do multiple things. What's important is your happiness. </p>
<p>I think here is where I have to quickly draw the distinction between happiness and pleasure. Happiness is something that you feel at no expense of others. Happiness can also be shared with others. In other words, happiness has the broader community involved. When someone has a newborn baby or when someone graduates are examples of shared communal happiness. When you achieve something,  such as a pay raise or reach certain fitness goals, those are private happiness, but with the ability of being shared. People can be happy for you, or you're able to make others happy with that achievement.</p>
<p>Pleasure on the other hand is entirely private, and has the danger of becoming destructive. The five of the seven sins are the perfect caricature of pleasure. Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth and wrath. These are activities which you indulge in purely for your own sake. They cannot be shared, and an overindulgence can lead to self destruction. It's okay to do pleasurable things, but they must be actively moderated. Eating unhealthy but tasty food, sleeping in and doing nothing, masturbation (contentious), playing video games are all pleasurable, and too much of it destroys oneself.</p>
<p>Back to the point of doing, we should therefore engage in activities that bring about happiness, and cautiously engage in pleasurable activities. It's fine if you do multiple things. Some people find certain activities more appealing, and hence focus their efforts on it. Others find multiple activities appealing, and their efforts are more diverse instead of directed. There is no right or wrong, because in the end, both paths lead to happiness.</p>
