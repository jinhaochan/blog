<p>[<strong>Give</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Giving is the greatest way to achieve happiness, both to the receiver and yourself. Giving can be done in many ways, such as money, words, and even time. By giving something you have to another person, it makes everyone a little bit happier.</p>
<p>[<strong>Relate</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Relating and connecting to someone makes the person feel cared for and loved. We humans are social creatures and we desire attention. By relating to someone and making them know we (genuinely) care about them, it makes them happier, and in turn, it makes us happy, because we care about them.</p>
<p>[<strong>Exercise</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Not only does it improve your physical health, it also improves your mental health. You gain more confidence, and you learn to push your boundaries and break plateaus. A good exercise challenges you both physical and mentally</p>
<p>[<strong>Appreciate</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Gratitude. Instead of focusing on what you don't have and your weaknesses, appreciate what you already have, and your strengths. Acknowledge your achievements, and allow that to propel you forward to achieve even more. If you are constantly looking at the gap between what you have and what you want, you're forever stuck in a negative cycle of discontentment. Instead, take time to look back, and let it empower you.</p>
<p>[<strong>Teach yourself</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Learn new skills every now and then, be it technical skills or people skills. Research well into your profession and learn new things to increase your proficiency. Learn from situations, from people, and from yourself (What pulls your strings? What motivates you? What do you like?).</p>
