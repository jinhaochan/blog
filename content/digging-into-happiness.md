I realized that i am writing lesser now. lt appears thet somehow I find it to be a chore. Perhaps I will start writing shorter paragraphs, and more spontaneous posts. Something like tweets.

These few days I have been thinking about happiness, probably due to my new job. After digging around and picking my brain, heres what I came up with.

It all starts with dissatisfaction, an unhappiness of sorts towards something, someone or and event. We dislike the process. We dislike the outcome. We dislike our involvement in it. But where does this unhappiness stem from?

It comes from the mismatch between **reality** and our **desires**. We desire for things to go smoothly, for our jobs not to suck, for a loving relationship, for trusting friends. But most of the time, reality is not so kind towards us, and presents us with situations that are often misaligned with our desires.

So, to get satisfaction and happiness, these reality and desires must be aligned. There are two things you can do here:

1\) Put in effort and work hard, so that the **realities** shape into your **desires**.

You want a good body, you want good grades in school, you want to make money. These things can be actualized through hardwork and effort. These realities can be formed and moulded into your desires. Lets call them **malleable realities**.

2\) Recognize that no amount of hardwork and effort can change reality, and change your desires to accept reality, and the beauty of it.

The world is in a mess, world hunger and global warming plauges us. Your stubborn boss bites at you at every chance. No matter what you do, you cannot change reality. And your desires can never be met. Lets call these **intractable realities**. They cannot be controlled or directed by your effort, so let them be.

The key here is to understand which realities are malleable, and which are intractable. By correctly classifying realities, you can then direct your effort to the right places.

There is much disappointment to be met, when you direct huge effort to an intractable reality. There is much satisfaction to be obtained, when you mould the malleable realities with effort to match your desires.

As for me now, my job seems... like an intractable reality. I can either change my desires and expectations of the job, or mould reality, and find another that meets my desires.
