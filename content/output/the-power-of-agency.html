</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Agency is having the feeling that you're in control of the situation at hand, and of yourself.</p>
<p>This post is a review of the book "The Power of Agency", and they offer 7 steps for you to regain this sense of control</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep a clear head and control the amount of stimuli you get</li>
<li>Associate selectively with people</li>
<li>Exercise and move</li>
<li>Always position yourself as a learner no matter where you are</li>
<li>Keep your emotions in check</li>
<li>Learn how to read your intuition</li>
<li>Deliberate before acting</li>
</ol>
<h2>Keeping a clear head</h2>
<hr>
<p>Practice meditation</p>
<p>Dont multitask</p>
<p>Filter your sources of information</p>
<p>Reduce junk information (social media)</p>
<p>Put away your phone. Far far away.</p>
<p>A traditional pen and paper brings more clarity as opposed to typing</p>
<p>Embrace boredom, and use it as a moment for self reflection</p>
<h2>Associate Selectively</h2>
<hr>
<p>You have Mirror neurons. Mix around with positive people, and you will mirror them</p>
<p>Other people have Mirror neurons. Act positively and others will follow suit</p>
<p>Dont fall into the herd mentality, and disassociate yourself from negative emotions</p>
<p>Learn to say No</p>
<p>Being unpopular is okay</p>
<p>Make or break unhealthy relationships</p>
<h2>Exercise and Move</h2>
<hr>
<p>Walk more</p>
<p>Stand more</p>
<p>Learn to understand the signals your body is giving you (Hungry? Tired?)</p>
<p>Go and experience new places and cultures</p>
<p>Make sleep a priority</p>
<h2>Always be Learning</h2>
<hr>
<p>Pursue new knowledge not within your domain</p>
<p>Learn to embrace failure in learning</p>
<p>Find out what kind if learner are you</p>
<p>Get feedback from others</p>
<p>Bounce and voice out your thought chains and get validation</p>
<p>Look from other peoples perspective</p>
<h2>Keep Your Emotions In Check</h2>
<hr>
<p>Values are not Beliefs. Values are more general. Beliefs are more specific</p>
<p>Tear down misconstructed beliefs from the past. They may not be valid</p>
<p>Identify emotions with names and words</p>
<p>Look at the grander scheme of things</p>
<p>Channel your emotions somewhere</p>
<h2>Intuition</h2>
<hr>
<p>I personally didn't like this chapter, because I find the lessons quite gray and not very concrete.</p>
<p>It seems to just say, trust your heart, which is, to me, one of the worse advice to give anyone.</p>
<h2>Deliberation</h2>
<hr>
<p>Dont be seduced by shortcuts</p>
<p>Name your mental steps to your conclusion</p>
<p>Question the decision you made</p>
<p>Stay open to alternatives</p>
<p>Ask yourself 3 questions for each decision</p>
<ol>
<li>How did I arrive to that decision</li>
<li>What other alternatives are there</li>
<li>How am I feeling during the decision making process</li>
</ol>
