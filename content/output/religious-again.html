</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Should I go back to being religious? It seems like I have strayed away from the person I sought myself to be.</p>
<p>After doing away with religion, I have fallen back on pure logic. Pure naturalistic logic, while at the same time compromising on abstracted morals related to certain actions.</p>
<p>With no rules, I have taken the bottom up approach, as mentioned in my previous post. My actions are guided from what I think is right, and then I go on to mould and reshape my beliefs to justify them.</p>
<p>But now I feel that something is wrong. I feel wrong inside. It feels.. unnatural. Ironic, since they are guided by natural instincts.</p>
<p>If I wish to take the Top-down view of things, the return to religion, it would be optimal.</p>
<p>The issue here is: the reason I am going back to religion is not because I believe in it. It is not because I fear the consequnces of being a non-believer, but only because it grounds me, and gives me a base, one that I initially sought without religion to much apparent failure, to guide my thoughts and actions.</p>
<p>Hence, I am being religious not for a religous purpose, but for a moral purpose.</p>
<p>Which religion should I choose? Prime consideration would be one that has believes I subcribe to. Secondary consideration would be that it has a support group who shares the same spiritual (not religious) belief as I do. Other considerations include doing away with idols and rituals, a non-conformist approach to show devotion, and one that gives me sufficient solace.</p>
<p>Its time to go back.</p>
