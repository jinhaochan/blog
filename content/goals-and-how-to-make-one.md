If the essence of life has inherent positivity, then there would be no such thing as boredom.

Just by mere existence, would bring about satisfaction and content. Just by being, will suffice. But that is never the case.

We get bored, and we feel valueless when we merely exist. The meaning of life has no meaning in just being, and so we seek out to do.We set goals to strive for.

Goals that are difficult and distance, of which those properties gives us a belief that there would be satisfaction in the end. The harder the goal, the more hope it gives us that happiness can be attained. The more complex and distant the goal, the more we can justify ourselves for being satisfied.

There are some people, undoubtly, relish in boredom. They do not see a need to strive for a goal, and are satisfied being bored. This aimlessness, I consider a plauge.

By setting goals that are too easily achieveable, it poses no challenge to us, and gives us little satisfaction. And even if we set a longer and harder goal, there will still be no guarantee it will give us satisfaction when we finally reach it. An unfazed graduate who finished his years of education. A disgruntled super car owner.

Again, the premise here is that when we set goals, it gives us hope and optimism that it will lead to satisfaction. The strategy here is to set a goal that is impossible to quantify. A goal that is larger than yourself. Abiding by morals, devoting to a religion, patrotism to your country, living for others. And because these are not quantifiable, there will always be hope granted by these goals.

And as we derive such hopefulness from our goals, we become satisfied with life.

\*(A distinction must be made here between short term goals, and lifelong goals. Short term goals are still practical and necessary. But we must be cautious on what we place our finger on our lifelong goals)
