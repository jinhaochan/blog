<p>I recently finished reading this book by Anthony Robbins, called Unlimited Power. It teaches a lot of personal mastery techniques which, surprisingly to my highly skeptical nature, actually works!</p>
<p>Here are a few high level abstractions of the lessons he taught:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>[Changing your internal representation:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>This lesson was really interesting, because all of us already have internal representations of things, events and people. Also, when new experiences come in, when we meet new people, we form representations of them based on our <strong>previous</strong> experiences and <strong>prior</strong> internal representations. So this thing about internal representations is actually really power, thus, knowing how to control it, and tweak it to have <strong>positive</strong> internal representation of certain things would be immensely helpful.</p>
<p>[Example:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>"I dislike my work. I feel that work stressed me out. At the end of the day, I feel extremely tired and unfruitful." For the most of us, that is our current internal representation. So when we go to work, we are casting a <strong>brand new day</strong> into this negative internal representation. By breaking this internal representation and casting it into a <strong>positive internal representation</strong>, we will be able to face our challenges in a new way.</p>
<p><p style="padding-left:30px;">
2.  [Pattern Breaking:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>We are creatures of habit. When we do something, it is mostly likely because it is a habit. This action can be brought over from other events, as the habit is a manifestation of your inner psychology. You over-eat, you over-sleep, you over-do-stuff. This pattern repeats itself over and over again, each time <strong>reinforcing</strong> this pattern, strengthening the connections within your brain that you <strong>must </strong>do some actions, when presented with a certain situation. To break this negative cycle, we have to perform <strong>pattern breaking</strong>. Its pretty simple: confuse the mind. Form new neurological paths when presented with this situation. Do something you've never done before when you face a common vice. Do something <strong>REALLY</strong> powerful and weird to shock the brain. Feel like smoking? Throw the cigarette on the floor and do a Haka dance and smash it all up.</p>
<p>[Example:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>"I'm always feeling sad. When I feel sad, I feel even more helpless and sadder that I can't do anything about it. I feel depressed I can't cheer up." Caught in this cycle? Burst out into laughter. Do a cheerful crazy dance. Go out and sprint as hard and fast as you can, and smile while doing it. These things break the pattern of spiralling sadness. (True story)</p>
<p><p style="padding-left:30px;">
3.  [How to identify a personality:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>What I feel is the most important lesson from this book, the seven indicators to identify a personality. There won't be any examples for this one because they are pretty self explanatory. Here they are:</p>
<p>Are you moving towards, or moving away?</p>
<p>When you perform an action, do you do it because you want to avoid something, or because you want to achieve something? Do you work because you want to grow as a person, or do you wish to avoid living in poverty?</p>
<p>Do you have a strong internal or external frame of reference?</p>
<p>How much weight do you put on other people's words? How much weight do you put on your words? If someone said you did a bad job, but you felt you did amazing, would he affect your judgement?</p>
<p>Do you sort by self or sort by others?</p>
<p>How oriented are your actions towards to others? Do you do things for the betterment of the group? Or do actions always have to have some form of personal gain?</p>
<p>Are you a matcher or a mis-matcher?</p>
<p>When you first see two objects/people, do you first identify their similarities, or their differences? Do you find what contrasts them, or how do they complement each other?</p>
<p>What does it take to convince you?</p>
<p>If I told you someone was good at something, what does it take to convince you? Do you have to see him perform it yourself? If so, how many times does he have to do it in-front you before you conclude he is really good at it?</p>
<p>Do you seek possibilities or necessities?</p>
<p>Do you find possibilities in your work and life, or do you find necessities? Are you exploratory and find creative means to live your life, or are you satiated with the bare minimum of necessities?</p>
<p>Are you independent or a group worker?</p>
<p>Do you like working alone, or in a group? Do you prefer to make your own decisions, or get another person's assurance before doing something? This could be a hybrid, where you get advice from people, but you end up doing the actual work yourself.</p>
<p style="padding-left:30px;">

</li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, that's all the lessons I can remember, or bother to type out. It's a really good book if you wish to explore yourself more. These books usually sell themselves as you suddenly being able to break out into a marvellous new person. Not a chance. But there are some golden nuggets there you can pick out, and these are the few I picked :)</p>
