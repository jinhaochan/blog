    <p>I've always been drawn toward software development, and the UI/UX part of it. Recently, I stumbled upon this package called Semantic-UI, which integrates well with react. You can install it by calling</p>
<p><code>npm i semantic-ui-react</code></p>
<p>I've not touched frontend coding for quite awhile, almost a year and a half, so I decided to jump back in because it seemed really fun to build stuff that you can see and interact with. My day job consists of writing endless python scripts, and while that's fun because it challenges you logically, there's no end product to look at and marvel at it.</p>
<p>Granted, when using Semantic-UI, I'm not the one doing the component designs, but just piecing them together. And that's the beauty of React! It's meant to be a plug and play of different components, and data is floated between them through what they call <code>props</code>.</p>
<p>You can see the project I'm working on here: https://pure-woodland-41150.herokuapp.com/</p>
<p>It takes awhile to load because I'm using a free Dyno from Heroku.</p>
<h2>Project Bookie</h2>
<hr>
<p>The idea that I'm working on really stems from a need for me to keep my book reviews in one place. Right now, I'm reading a ton of books, but there's no where for me to document them down digitally, where I can perform some analysis to it.</p>
<p>Sure, there's Evernote, but I find it too bloated and clunky. Plus, I could try to build it.</p>
<p>I envision the main functionality to be reading summaries of books, and user reviews pulled from different APIs. Also, you can see similar books, and where to purchase them. (Of course you can always go to Book Depository)</p>
<p>I don't foresee this to be a monetized project, but a personal exploration of learning, or relearning front end coding.</p>
<p>At the side, I'm thinking of adding Machine Learning stuff like text analytics, to automatically find similar books based on tags.</p>
<p>Who knows, I might enjoy this process so much, that I might go back to software development (Which I think i got off the wrong foot with in my first job.)</p>
