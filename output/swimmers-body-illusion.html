<p>Are swimmer's body good looking because of their constant swimming activities? Or do they excel in swimming because of their good physic? It is important not to confuse the cause with the effect, but apparently it is happening almost everywhere.</p>
<p>Education: People tend to confuse hard work with smartness, although smartness tends to be more sought after than hard work. If you can't outsmart them, out work them. Not everyone is born with the same mental capacity to grasp concepts easily. Some people just need to hear it once, and that is all it takes for them to fully understand. Likewise, not everyone is able to commit and put it a lot of effort to understand something. Lets be real, we get a bit lazy sometimes. So we have to evaluate ourselves, how smart are we? How hardworking are we? It seems it's harder to improve your cognitive abilities to be "Smarter", therefore, if we are lacking in any areas, we can only put in hard work. Do not look at others in envy and say "Oh, he does not study yet his results are fantastic." Do not attempt to adopt his studying methods. Do attempt to replicate his schedule and life. All of his time management and choices were made to be suited for him, and not for you. Just as a swimmers body was made for swimming, and not the converse.</p>
<p>Fitness: How we train affects how we look. The more we train and the harder we train, the better the results. But how our bodies are in turn affects how we must train. A skinny body should cut down on cardiovascular activities, and focus more on gaining mass. A bulky body should not be focusing on lifting heavy weights, but engage in cardiovascular exercises. There is no one-size-fit-all training regime, because all our sizes are different, and its impossible to see the the same results from each different body given the same training regime. Instead of studying how others train, seek to understand your own body first. Your structural imbalances ( hip anterior/posterior tilts), your weaknesses (legs, arms), your own body size (endo, meso, ecto), your lifestyle (working adult, sedentary, very active). The list is not exhaustive, and there are countless of other factors that will affect your gains. Only once your have understood your body, you have then obtained the question, and the next step is to seek the answer. Do not look at bodybuilders and follow their regime. Their job is to build their body for competitions, thus their lifestyle is intrinsically different from yours, unless of course you are a bodybuilder yourself. Seek for more attainable goals and answers. Find a training regime to suit your lifestyle. Some bodies and lives were made for a good physic, and not the other way around.</p>
<p>For now I have only gave these two examples, for they dominate most of my life at the moment (I'm a student who workouts often). But just give it a thought and you will see how the Swimmers body illusion really affects many areas in life. Just to throw out a few more: Work, Character, Affluence, Family relations.</p>
<p>I think the bottom line of this is that, we should stop following people. Their lives and circumstances are entirely different from ours. We have our own lives that we have to find out for ourselves how the puzzles fits. There is no singular perfect answer for all our problems. Just because they succeeded, does not mean you will.
