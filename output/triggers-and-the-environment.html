    <p>I've recently finished reading a book by Marshall Goldsmith titled "Triggers", and in it details some very interesting bits of information.</p>
<p>Before I go on to explain them, I would like to say that in the past, I was rather skeptical about reading such books. Books that teach you about life skills, and talks about seemingly obvious stuff. But now, I've come to realize that maybe I don't know myself as much as I would like to, and the seemingly obvious was actually hidden from me, working unconsciously. Books that give me actionable insights on myself and onto others around me now draw my attention. A different phase of life requires a different set of guidance.</p>
<p>Now, on to the actual topics and take away points of the book.</p>
<p>There were many topics covered in the books, such as a slight introduction to psychology, decision fatigue, touching on willpower and other common themes that find their place in self-help books. I would like to focus however, on a few very specific points that he made, which I felt was what I was paying the money for.</p>
<p>If the points could be summarized into a diagram, here it is</p>
<p><img alt="Presentation1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-558" height="720" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/presentation1.jpg" width="960"></p>
<p>The environment that we are in induces certain triggers within us, whether we like it or not. As much self control we think we have, these triggers find their way into our minds unwillingly.</p>
<p>When a trigger gets activated, say a colleague you detest walks in, or you arrive to work where its a stressful place, you will then face impulses. Impulses to do a certain set of pre-learned actions that put into safety. For example, if we get a stress trigger, we may have an impulse to eat food to calm our nerves.</p>
<p>These impulsive behaviors caused by the triggers may not always be good. Shoving your face with food every time you feel stressed doesn't seem like a very healthy thing to do. Therefore, we must develop awareness of these impulsive behaviors. Before we act on anything, we have to be aware of it. Once we are aware, we can then <strong>rationally </strong>make our choices.</p>
<p>Here's a simple scenario that puts all of that into play:</p>
<ol>
<li>I go to work</li>
<li>The work environment is stressful</li>
<li>The stressful environment triggers me</li>
<li>An impulsive action that has been triggered is to munch on comfort sugary food</li>
<li>I am aware that I have these impulses</li>
<li>I am aware that I have a choice to not carry out these actions</li>
<li>I choose not to eat the glazed donuts</li>
</ol>
<p>And this scenario can be emulated in almost any environment. From your boredom at home that triggers excessive napping, to feeling stressed that triggers smoking, to meeting someone you have animosity with that triggers angry words.</p>
<p>The key take away from this lesson is to ultimately stop acting out on undesirable impulsive actions. And I personally feel that the greater lesson here is to learn how to have awareness of your own thoughts. Once you are aware, you can rationalize. Otherwise, it'll just be on autopilot mode.</p>
<p>The book also taught me a simple exercise to do for myself. It's called the wheel of change. It tells us to identify areas in our life that we should:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create</li>
<li>Eliminate</li>
<li>Preserve</li>
<li>Accept</li>
</ol>
<p>To show a naive example of this in practice: Creating better friendships, Eliminate toxic people, Preserving current friends, and Accepting friends for who they are.</p>
<p>I took this exercise and combined it with the 4 circles of life, namely Social, Spiritual, Professional, and Personal. In the end, it sort of looks like a table like this.</p>
<p><img alt="Presentation1" class="alignnone wp-image-586" height="467" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/presentation11.jpg" width="623"></p>
<p>I've spent a day on this table and filled it up with all the events to create, eliminate, preserve and accept. I've then stuck it right in front of me on my desk to constantly remind me of the work I need to do.</p>
<p>P.S. I think as i'm starting to read more books at a greater frequency, I should start doing a book review on them. A review would help me recap the points that I've learnt, as well as to share the insights with others.</p>
