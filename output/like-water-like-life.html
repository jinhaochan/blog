		<p>What the osfork? Just like the pythonic way of spawning off different processes by invoking <p style="font-family:courier;">os.fork</p>, this website is meant to have different processes of content.</p>
		<p>From technical stuff, to books I've read, and ramblings about life, all my thought processes are here.</p>

    <p>Life is analogous to water.</p>
<p>Water flows; to give life; to create; to quench a thirst; to show beauty.</p>
<p>To destroy; to drown; to wash away; to drench a man.</p>
<p>What does your water flow for?</p>
<p>What is your life for?</p>
<p>How you direct your energy of life, decides how you impact those around you. How you decide to lead your life, impacts all those around you. To what morals you align your life to, influences things around you.</p>
<p>Water doesn't have any meaning. There is no tangible reality which water emulates to give it meaning.</p>
<p>Thing that do have meaning, sees itself as a comparison of likeliness to another.</p>
<p>Smiling means happiness. Frowning means sadness. Banging your fist on the table means anger. Running away means fear.</p>
<p>Water means?</p>
<p>But what water lacks in meaning, it compensates with purpose, beneficial or destructive, it has no preference.</p>
<p>Perhaps, life has no meaning then. For what tangible emulations does life exhibit? What understandable experience can we fit life into? When all possible tangible emulations are contained within, and arises from life, finding a comparison would be illogical.</p>
<p>Again, like water, life compensates the lack of meaning with purpose, which too has no preference.</p>
<p>While life then has no preference of a beneficial or destructive purpose, it is guided by the desires of man. And it is here that social dynamics takes place, with our best efforts to achieve what is beneficial to everyone. A rare few have their desires guided towards destruction, and it is those we condemn.</p>
<p>So, putting it shortly: Life is driven by beneficial purposes.</p>
<p>Benefits for others.</p>
<p>Benefits for self.</p>
<p>Benefits, being entirely qualitative, I shall not attempt to delve into.</p>
<p>Perhaps then, we should stop asking "What is the meaning of life", for as explained earlier, it is a paradox to caricaturize a thing in itself.</p>
<p>Instead, we should be asking "What is the purpose of my life". And it is with a strong desire that I hope it is a beneficial one.</p>
<p>And just as the first drops of water taste the sweetest, despite the lack of taste. Just as the first gush of it is filled with rejuvenation, it slowly turns stale.</p>
<p>It starts to be a bother. Bloated, over-hydrated. The mouth accustomed to the taste sips it in disdain.</p>
<p>Life then, is also the sweetest at its inception. The burst of youth and ideas. The jovial experiences. The endearing curiosity of the young man.</p>
<p>It slows, becomes a burden. The familiarity brings with it disappointment.</p>
<p>So enjoy the initial taste, for it only comes once.</p>
<p>And after the bottle is empty, it may be refilled*.</p>
<p>But those are not for you anymore,</p>
<p>For you had your fill.</p>
<p>(* I say this because I do have certain spiritual inclinations. For the non-spiritual, you can view it as new life being brought to earth)</p>
