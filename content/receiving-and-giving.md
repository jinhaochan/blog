There are two ways to achieve happiness. You either receive something from both yourself or others, or you can give something to others. 

Examples of receiving something that makes you happy: you eat good food; you have received a good meal. You have a good sleep; you have received a good rest. Someone gives you a compliment; you have received praise. All the things on which you are on the receiving end that makes you happy, are things that nourishes you; your mind, body and soul. You have taken in something from the exterior. In fact, this is the more natural way we achieve happiness, but if we indulge too much in receiving, we become entitled and selfish. Natural, because it is in our instincts to seek pleasure. Selfish, because we may infringe on others happiness.

To prevent an over-indulgence or dependence on being on the receiving end of things, we need to acknowledge that giving can be just as rewarding, if not more. Giving a hug, giving a compliment, giving time,  giving love, giving up your rights. There's a saying I read long ago: five up your rights for other people's happiness. Give up your happiness for other people's rights. Giving is not as natural as receiving, because it is somehow seen as being on the losing end, and we all don't like to lose. But is it really? There is almost always nothing to lose when you give, and in fact, both parties (the giver and the receiver) both have a net increase in happiness. 

The difference between giving and receiving is that you can only give within your means, a constrain that requires effort. Receiving requires absolutely no effort, and there is no limit to how much one can receive. As such, it is a lot easier to receive than to give. But it is the effort in giving that makes it so much more worthy and satisfactory. And this applies almost to everything else. The illusion of happiness in non-effort in life.

Put in a little effort, give a little more, exhibit gusto, do away with the life of passivity, and you'll see that it's a lot more worth living and bearable.
