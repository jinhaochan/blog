&lt;li&gt;Not …&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I've seen this book around for quite some time, but have been avoiding it because i'm quite saturated with self-help books. However, one day I decided to make an impulse purchase on this, and I've definitely not regretted it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are some of the summary points he made:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not giving a f*ck does &lt;strong&gt;NOT&lt;/strong&gt; mean indifference. It means that you have a goal you want to achieve, and you don't give a f*ck about what it takes to get it. (criticism, doubt, naysayers)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It's important to give a f*ck about something. This can be translated to: It's important to find a problem you want to solve (This is as opposed to: It's important to find something that makes you happy!) By finding a problem you are interested in and you want to solve, you are then willing to go through the suffering that entails solving the problem, and the following satisfaction (or the elusive happiness!). Problems -&amp;gt; Solutions -&amp;gt; Satisfaction&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace mediocrity. You are not the special 1% high achievers. You are the 99% that makes the rest of the world. Being normal and average is okay, that's why its called the average. If everyone was special, then special would be average, and the next tier would be exceptionally special (which, if every special person thought they would be, it would become average again). Don't stress about being &lt;strong&gt;THE &lt;/strong&gt;best. STRIVE to be &lt;strong&gt;YOUR&lt;/strong&gt; best. And even if your best is globally average, so what?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take responsibility for everything that's happening to you, emphasis being on feelings. Don't offload the responsibility of feeling happy to someone else. If someone is an asshole to you, you are responsible to how you feel about it. If you hate your job and your bosses, you are responsible to do something about it. Once you take ownership of things in your life, you will have more control and direction over where it's headed. Stop victimizing yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Questions your beliefs. You've had them for a long time, and it got you to where you are. The kicker is: [Did you get here &lt;strong&gt;BECAUSE&lt;/strong&gt; of it, or did you get here &lt;strong&gt;IN SPITE&lt;/strong&gt; of it?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Tear down and evaluate your beliefs. An example: I used to belief that if people didn't make time for me, they didn't care about me. That's extremely selfish thinking, and obviously not true. They are just as busy as you are. Safe to say, that belief has been torn down. Don't be so sure about yourself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you feel like you're not motivated to do stuff, then this simple graph will help you: Actions -&amp;gt; Inspiration -&amp;gt; Motivation -&amp;gt; Action. Simple, to get motivated, you have to start.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Following the action from point 6: When you do anything, commit yourself entire to doing it. Don't half ass your way through life. Do it well. Read in depth. Understand everything about that problem and domain (to the best of your ability). Aim high up to master it, and even if you fail, you would have landed pretty far anyway. &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;"Aim For The Stars, If You Fail, You'll Land On The Moon."&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now i'll elaborate on a thought or an idea that came when reading this book, which is how to measure success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success should be measured by a metric that is entirely under &lt;strong&gt;YOUR &lt;/strong&gt;control. It's something stems directly from your effort, not others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's an example of a measurement using a metric not within your control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success means people like me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can't control how people feel, so success is very volatile and questionable. Does he really like you? Or does he pretend to, to get something from you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we phrase it such that the measurement is in your control:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success means people trust me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can control this by having integrity, by not lying and cheating people. People will distrust you when you lie to them over and over again. When you promise to deliver, but you fail repeatedly. Building trust is entirely in your control: you choose to break it or not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more common example would be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is when me and my friends communicate and hang out often&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That seems fine, but you can't control your friends schedules or availability. If they get very busy with life and work, and fail to hang out with you, would YOU have failed?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's how to phrase it better:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success is when I'm there for my friends when they need me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There we go, now control is entirely in your hands. If your friends need you and require your assistance, physically or emotionally, will YOU be there? Now you can truly measure success, because it's entirely contingent on your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, success in all areas of life should be measured by things YOU can do. And in the event of a failure, it is entirely YOUR fault (see taking responsibility). Once you acknowledge it's YOUR fault, you can do something to change it. If it's not your fault, chances are, you can't change it. And if that's the case, don't give a f*ck will you?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Bioinformatics</title><link href="/bioinformatics.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-07-18T16:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-07-18T16:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-07-18:/bioinformatics.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've been doing this Coursera Specialization called Bioinformatics &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/bioinformatics"&gt;(Link to course page)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The course shows us how to apply computational solutions to non-computational, but highly complex problems. The complexity of Bioinformatics comes from the huge amount of data (huge meaning billions), and how different permutations and combinations of those data points produce vastly difference outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The data points in question are called &lt;strong&gt;Nucleotides,  &lt;/strong&gt;which form the basis of &lt;strong&gt;DNA&lt;/strong&gt;. (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwibgNGe4aY"&gt;Check out the videos here for a quick crash course in DNA and stuff&lt;/a&gt;). A lot of the problems are solved using Pattern-Finding algorithms, with a huge emphasis on Big-O and optimization over time. Given a huge collection of Nucleotides, we want to find patterns in them to tell us interesting stories. An example would be trying to find a pattern within the DNA that translates to producing the protein that regulates your sleep cycle.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some of the Computer Science concepts used in the course include Graph Theory (Euler Cycles, Paths, DeBruijn) and Matrix Manipulations (Laplace Rule of Succession). Aside from those, there are other complex solutions that are specific to Bioinformatics (Motif Finding, Profile Generation, Mass Spectrum Consistency).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The choice of language I chose to was Python&lt;strong&gt;3&lt;/strong&gt; (emphasis on 3) mainly due to flexibility and familiarity. I believe my life would have been much easier if I adopted data science packages such as Numpy and Pandas for large data manipulations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The coding problems were fun, and extremely challenging, which was what I was looking for. I've been building Web applications, Java applications, Kernel modules and a little bit of Mobile Programming, all of which had very similar applications: Building an end-product for consumers. Bioinformatics on the other hand, showed me a whole new set of problems which required me to take a very different thought approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It showed me that Python can not only be used for scripting to automate mundane tasks, or build a web framework like Django. Instead, it can also be used to find mutations in your DNA, or how to sequence antibiotics, which is all pretty darn cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've completed the first course: &lt;strong&gt;Finding Hidden Messages in DNA (Bioinformatics I)&lt;/strong&gt;, and i'm finishing up with the second course: &lt;strong&gt;Genome Sequencing (Bioinformatics II)&lt;/strong&gt;. There are 7 courses in total, but I don't think i'll be doing all of them. Those two courses alone were enough to satisfy my curiosity in finding out other uses of Python.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My codes that I wrote are on my Github page here: &lt;a href="https://github.com/Charmanderander/bioinfo"&gt;Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I must admit, its not very clean or optimized code, but only because I did it in one iteration. In actual practice, code is meant to be destroyed and rewritten, because the first iteration gives you the idea, and the subsequent ones optimizes over it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get lazy sometimes :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Bioinformatics"></category><category term="Coursera"></category></entry><entry><title>The Anomaly</title><link href="/the-anomaly.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-02-25T16:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-02-25T16:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-02-25:/the-anomaly.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Death is not an anomaly to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life is an anomaly to death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life is the antithesis to the hundreds and millions of years of nonexistence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A sudden spurt of existence, and all the emotions that come along with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness and sadness. Lust and love. Compassion and scorn. Empathy and envy. Pleasure and pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A few years of existence, a fiesty pause to the infinite years of oblivion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fear not Death, for it is the natural state we all came from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Waste not Life, for it presents a short chance of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The absence of the fear of death, and the presence of the gusto for life allows you to live it fully, to each his own definition of fullness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anomaly is the awareness you gain in life. The anomaly is the free will you inherited. The anomaly is the choice you are allowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use them well and appreciate them. Teach others to appreciate them as well. Having to a wrong view on what little life we have is an abhorrent waste.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We all return to the natural state in the end that is nonexistence. The absence of awareness, free will and choice. That is the natural state. Seize what you have now and live life greatly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.s this post was inspired after I went for an operation, and was put under general anesthesia. To me, the lost of conscious thought was akin to dying, and it was the closest I felt to Death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was initially afraid, and asked the doctor how it would feel like. He told me it would be just like going to sleep and waking up. I guess in the context of Death, it's going to sleep and not waking up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Within this period of anesthesia induced sleep, I felt absolutely nothing and had no recollection of what happened. I then thought, perhaps the fear of Death lies in the fear of what one would experience after life, and because no one has lived to tell the tale (pun intended), it then translates to the fear of the unknown.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My experience with general anesthesia then showed me that there is absolutely nothing. No experience, no memory, no thought, no knowledge of time. What's there to fear about nothingness? We end up fearing nothing, and to put a play on words, we should therefore fear nothing.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>On Doing and Happiness</title><link href="/on-doing-and-happiness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2018-01-14T10:11:00+00:00</published><updated>2018-01-14T10:11:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2018-01-14:/on-doing-and-happiness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I wrote some post a while back that explored what I felt that I should do, and to some extent, embarking on my passion hunt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now feel that passion should not be tied down to one specific action. Be it a passion for sports, or drawing, or technology. Passion should be about life and living. We weren't born to paint, or to play basketball. We were born to live, and what we do with the life we live makes it worth while.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whatever makes you happy, you should pursue it. Don't be troubled that multiple things make you happy, and that you're a Jack of all trades, master of none. It's okay to want to do multiple things. What's important is your happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think here is where I have to quickly draw the distinction between happiness and pleasure. Happiness is something that you feel at no expense of others. Happiness can also be shared with others. In other words, happiness has the broader community involved. When someone has a newborn baby or when someone graduates are examples of shared communal happiness. When you achieve something,  such as a pay raise or reach certain fitness goals, those are private happiness, but with the ability of being shared. People can be happy for you, or you're able to make others happy with that achievement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pleasure on the other hand is entirely private, and has the danger of becoming destructive. The five of the seven sins are the perfect caricature of pleasure. Lust, gluttony, greed, sloth and wrath. These are activities which you indulge in purely for your own sake. They cannot be shared, and an overindulgence can lead to self destruction. It's okay to do pleasurable things, but they must be actively moderated. Eating unhealthy but tasty food, sleeping in and doing nothing, masturbation (contentious), playing video games are all pleasurable, and too much of it destroys oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back to the point of doing, we should therefore engage in activities that bring about happiness, and cautiously engage in pleasurable activities. It's fine if you do multiple things. Some people find certain activities more appealing, and hence focus their efforts on it. Others find multiple activities appealing, and their efforts are more diverse instead of directed. There is no right or wrong, because in the end, both paths lead to happiness.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hypervigilance and Mindfulness</title><link href="/hypervigilance-and-mindfulness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-12-26T13:35:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-12-26T13:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-12-26:/hypervigilance-and-mindfulness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Hypervigilance is being in a constant state of look out for potential dangers and threats.

Everything in a normal day could be viewed as a potential threat, and the endless worst case scenarios play out in all their different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being in this state usually has a history behind it, be it PSTD, or living in constant fear for your safety as a child. As a result, this hypervigilant behavior is brought together into adulthood, where the dangers are suddenly more real and all around us. Car accidents, terrorism, a plane crash, a leaking gas pipe that engulfs everyone in flames.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypervigilance is in effect mindfulness with fear attached to it. Mindfulness is the awareness of our surrounding, and of the people around us. To be mindful is to be in a state of peacefulness. You are aware of your surroundings, and you hold no feelings towards them. But once you start being aware of everything and being afraid of the unknown dangers, it turns into hypervigilance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't seek out unknown, or even non-existent threats. Just be aware and mindful of your surrounding. Attach no feelings to it, and you will be at peace.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Receiving and Giving</title><link href="/receiving-and-giving.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-10-16T01:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-10-16T01:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-10-16:/receiving-and-giving.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There are two ways to achieve happiness.

You either receive something from both yourself or others, or you can give something to others. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Examples of receiving something that makes you happy: you eat good food; you have received a good meal. You have a good sleep; you have received a good rest. Someone gives you a compliment; you have received praise. All the things on which you are on the receiving end that makes you happy, are things that nourishes you; your mind, body and soul. You have taken in something from the exterior. In fact, this is the more natural way we achieve happiness, but if we indulge too much in receiving, we become entitled and selfish. Natural, because it is in our instincts to seek pleasure. Selfish, because we may infringe on others happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To prevent an over-indulgence or dependence on being on the receiving end of things, we need to acknowledge that giving can be just as rewarding, if not more. Giving a hug, giving a compliment, giving time,  giving love, giving up your rights. There's a saying I read long ago: five up your rights for other people's happiness. Give up your happiness for other people's rights. Giving is not as natural as receiving, because it is somehow seen as being on the losing end, and we all don't like to lose. But is it really? There is almost always nothing to lose when you give, and in fact, both parties (the giver and the receiver) both have a net increase in happiness. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The difference between giving and receiving is that you can only give within your means, a constrain that requires effort. Receiving requires absolutely no effort, and there is no limit to how much one can receive. As such, it is a lot easier to receive than to give. But it is the effort in giving that makes it so much more worthy and satisfactory. And this applies almost to everything else. The illusion of happiness in non-effort in life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put in a little effort, give a little more, exhibit gusto, do away with the life of passivity, and you'll see that it's a lot more worth living and bearable. &lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Meaning</title><link href="/the-meaning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-09-02T06:09:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-09-02T06:09:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-09-02:/the-meaning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;What is the meaning of life?

Big question, and I approach this knowing that I can never find the answer. It is however, not the end that matters, but the means. The thought process. If I cannot find out what life is, at least I can deduce what life is not by thinking about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, let us define what is meaning when we attempt to use it to describe life:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The Meaning of Meaning]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we say that something as meaning, we can refer to two things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Description.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Significance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Meaning, when used as a description, simply describes an action, a word or anything that requires inference. His actions of banging the table &lt;strong&gt;means&lt;/strong&gt; he is angry. His tone of saying this word &lt;strong&gt;means &lt;/strong&gt;he is sarcastic. The way he dresses &lt;strong&gt;means &lt;/strong&gt;he is an outgoing purpose&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But when we refer to meaning as a significance, we are not describing anything, but ascribing something to it. Ascription, is defined as&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author*&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ascribe"&gt;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ascribe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, when we ask what is the meaning of life, we ascribe a significance to it, and that significance is the supposed cause of life. The supposed cause of why we are here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we have defined what we mean by meaning, let us proceed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Is the meaning of life to seek pleasure?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Humans instinctively seeks pleasure. We are pleasure driven, and want to feel good. Pleasurable food, pleasurable company, pleasurable work. But is the meaning to life just to seek out pleasure? Are we driven solely to seek pleasure? To me, this way of thinking sounds like we are holding too low of a standard to ourselves. Being pleasure driven limits our actions and thoughts to only a select few. Some actions are not pleasurable, but reaps enormous benefits. We must do those too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having only to seek pleasure seems a little selfish too, that all our actions should be guided towards making ourselves happy. It seems to imply the absence of consideration for others, because if we do, there would definitely be some degree of compromise involved on our personal pleasures.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is this the supposed cause of life? That we are here just to feel good and then pass on? It may fit the bill for some people, but not for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pleasure: Too low a standard. Too selfish.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Is the meaning of life to service about others?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be a valid meaning for some, but not to me. It requires you to hold a great deal of altruism, so much in fact that you are willing to forgo all of your needs to service others. I find that only religious people can lie in this category, because their goal is driven towards a divine unworldly being, and hence they are willing to forsake all that is earthly in return for Salvation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can an atheist or a non-believer do the same? To give up all of his belongings, his career and his wants to be of service to others. I do not think so, as the non-religious are bounded by the tangible. Without any promise of reward to give up their earthly belongings and personal goals, one would not be enticed to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That does not mean that the non-religious cannot love as much as the religious. Both parties can love another person to the same degree, but both take different actions to express their love. Both would dedicate their lives to the service of others, but the non-religious would still hold on to his part, while the religious has already given up that part to their God.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a good meaning to life. That we are here to help and assist others. It does not matter the degree of altruism, as long as we have it in mind. But to me, this does not seem significant enough to be my meaning to life. I cannot find myself dedicating a big part of my life and giving up all that I have to the service of others (Sorry, i'm just not that altruistic). Sure, I do give and contribute to society, but it is not a big part of me attribute this as the significance and meaning of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Service to others: Good and valid meaning, just not mine&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Is the meaning to life about reproduction?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The underlying biology in our genes drives us to find the perfect conditions to procreation and spreading life. However, we are lucky enough to be in a era (and country) where our basic needs of security is met. We have shelter, food, water, and all other basic necessities such that survival is not an immediate concern.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the absence of this constant threat of dying, we put our mental capabilities to good use and think in the abstract. Those whose basic necessities are already met, but still tirelessly seek them out are working to gain excess. The gluttonous and the materialist. They do not make use of the capabilities of their minds to give (ideas, abstraction), but are caught in the constant pleasures of what is already given (food, company).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reproduction: Conditions for reproduction are not a dire threat. Therefore no significance is gained in pursuing it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[The the meaning to life about knowledge]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I guess this is the only meaning that I find most appealing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of all the living things on the earth, we have the most powerful brain. Why shouldn't we use it? An alligator uses its strong jaws for hunting. The lion uses its lethal fangs for the kill. The bird uses its wings to fly. Yet humans, for all its physical deficiencies in murderous Savannah, triumphs because of the brain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wont go into detail the wondrous things the brain can do. It has helped us survive, and even more, thrive. One of the ways to train the brain and make use of its full potential is to gain knowledge. Technical knowledge (IT skills), Social knowledge (E.Q), General knowledge (I.Q), Moral knowledge (Beliefs), Spiritual knowledge (Religion) and many more. The key is to learn, and apply critical thinking onto the lessons learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, not everything can be known, and not everything can be understand by rationality. The thirst for knowledge is like a hungry man. Inquire too much, and you would never be full. Inquire nothing, and you would starve. Inquiring in the right amount, and putting faith in the unanswerable, keeps you fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This, amalgamated with the significance of service to others, can be the meaning of life, and also lead to a meaningful life*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To learn, To serve.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discere Servire&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* "Can be the meaning of life" is different from "Lead to a meaningful life". The former puts meaning in precedence, that we were placed here to fulfill the significance. The latter describes meaning as an emergent ascription, that is to say that life inherently has no meaning, but what we do gives it meaning. I believe that if we conclude the meaning to be both the prior and the posterior, we have found true meaning. I don't imagine this to be an easy task. Some find the prior without the posterior (A religious person who is stuck in a corporate job), and others, a posterior without the prior (A person who loves his job, but wonders if there is something greater). I am in the latter group, and I do know of a few people in the former group.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>MEDITATIONS; Book 3; IN CARNUNTUM by Marcus Aurelius</title><link href="/meditations-book-3-in-carnuntum-by-marcus-aurelius.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-07-24T13:34:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-07-24T13:34:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-07-24:/meditations-book-3-in-carnuntum-by-marcus-aurelius.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;"Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about&lt;br&gt;

I think that over the short period my career as a Software Engineer (Or a Systems Analyst) for 2 years has changed my perceptions quite a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things were much more straightforward as a fresh graduate. The only thing we were worried about was employment. Which company do i want to work in, which field of work do i want to dive into, how much starting salary should i aim for such that it is a good base were all the topics of discussion. Now, those were good questions to ask, but they were good and relevant only at that point of time. However, i'm long past that phase, and those questions have duly been answered, met, or just became irrelevant and obsolete. That does not mean that i should stop asking those types of questions. Life decisions and questions of which the answers influence your actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What kind of life do i want to lead, is the question I've been asking. Now that i have a stable job and a steady flow of income, i think i can safely say that I've moved up the rungs of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for me to think about esteem. When i use the word "esteem" here, i'm referring to the value i see in myself, and the intrinsic value i'm able to bring to society. What sort of life do i have to lead in order for me to feel that my life is valuable? What decisions do i have to make, professions i have to engage in, or people i have to help that would give me meaning? I guess in this sense, a valuable life is a meaningful life, therefore perhaps the question i should be asking is &lt;strong&gt;What Gives Life Meaning?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, i would like to take a quotation from a book "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl, where he says:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that &lt;em&gt;it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us&lt;/em&gt;. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our question must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in direct contradiction to the question i have in mind. He seems to allude a life of passivity in decisions, where you only react to the lemons being thrown at you. While I do agree with this sort of thinking, where &lt;em&gt;"Our question must consists, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct."&lt;/em&gt;, I feel that it should be augmented with another form of active thinking, and we should be doing both the passivity of reaction to life, as well as the proactive seeking to what we desire. Perhaps in his situation, the latter was not revealed to him as a choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have previously thought of some areas of life that, amalgamated together, give rise to meaning. They were: Self, Social, Spiritual and Professional. However, i've began to think that these were only generally good guidelines on how to compartmentalize my life, but not a guideline to find meaning, or how to direct my actions towards a more fulfilling life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inherently, we are all pleasure seeking, and a very general meaning we all have is the attainment of satisfaction. Things that make us or others happy is definitely meaningful. But that's still extremely broad. What kind pleasures are we speaking about? Pleasures of mental stimulation? Pleasures of the flesh? Pleasures of social interaction? Pleasures of recognition? I guess a way to go get closer to the answer is to get further abstracted away from the original question. What gives me pleasure? That which gives me pleasure, gives me meaning. That which gives me meaning, gives me value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think I shall leave answering this question for another post. What Gives Me Pleasure?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Triggers and the Environment</title><link href="/triggers-and-the-environment.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-04-12T10:05:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-04-12T10:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-04-12:/triggers-and-the-environment.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've recently finished reading a book by Marshall Goldsmith titled "Triggers", and in it details some very interesting bits of information.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before I go on to explain them, I would like to say that in the past, I was rather skeptical about reading such books. Books that teach you about life skills, and talks about seemingly obvious stuff. But now, I've come to realize that maybe I don't know myself as much as I would like to, and the seemingly obvious was actually hidden from me, working unconsciously. Books that give me actionable insights on myself and onto others around me now draw my attention. A different phase of life requires a different set of guidance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, on to the actual topics and take away points of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were many topics covered in the books, such as a slight introduction to psychology, decision fatigue, touching on willpower and other common themes that find their place in self-help books. I would like to focus however, on a few very specific points that he made, which I felt was what I was paying the money for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the points could be summarized into a diagram, here it is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Presentation1" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-558" height="720" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/presentation1.jpg" width="960"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment that we are in induces certain triggers within us, whether we like it or not. As much self control we think we have, these triggers find their way into our minds unwillingly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a trigger gets activated, say a colleague you detest walks in, or you arrive to work where its a stressful place, you will then face impulses. Impulses to do a certain set of pre-learned actions that put into safety. For example, if we get a stress trigger, we may have an impulse to eat food to calm our nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These impulsive behaviors caused by the triggers may not always be good. Shoving your face with food every time you feel stressed doesn't seem like a very healthy thing to do. Therefore, we must develop awareness of these impulsive behaviors. Before we act on anything, we have to be aware of it. Once we are aware, we can then &lt;strong&gt;rationally &lt;/strong&gt;make our choices.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here's a simple scenario that puts all of that into play:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I go to work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The work environment is stressful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The stressful environment triggers me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An impulsive action that has been triggered is to munch on comfort sugary food&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am aware that I have these impulses&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am aware that I have a choice to not carry out these actions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I choose not to eat the glazed donuts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And this scenario can be emulated in almost any environment. From your boredom at home that triggers excessive napping, to feeling stressed that triggers smoking, to meeting someone you have animosity with that triggers angry words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key take away from this lesson is to ultimately stop acting out on undesirable impulsive actions. And I personally feel that the greater lesson here is to learn how to have awareness of your own thoughts. Once you are aware, you can rationalize. Otherwise, it'll just be on autopilot mode.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book also taught me a simple exercise to do for myself. It's called the wheel of change. It tells us to identify areas in our life that we should:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliminate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preserve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Accept&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To show a naive example of this in practice: Creating better friendships, Eliminate toxic people, Preserving current friends, and Accepting friends for who they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I took this exercise and combined it with the 4 circles of life, namely Social, Spiritual, Professional, and Personal. In the end, it sort of looks like a table like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Presentation1" class="alignnone wp-image-586" height="467" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/presentation11.jpg" width="623"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've spent a day on this table and filled it up with all the events to create, eliminate, preserve and accept. I've then stuck it right in front of me on my desk to constantly remind me of the work I need to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;P.S. I think as i'm starting to read more books at a greater frequency, I should start doing a book review on them. A review would help me recap the points that I've learnt, as well as to share the insights with others.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Subjectivity of Suffering.</title><link href="/the-subjectivity-of-suffering-2.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-03-28T07:03:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-03-28T07:03:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-03-28:/the-subjectivity-of-suffering-2.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do we come to conclude that a certain event, or despairing predicament a person is in amounts to suffering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We know that we are suffering if we feel a certain amount of personal discomfort. The Sun is beating down on your exposed skin. Your legs weary from standing. Your heart aches from a sour relationship. Your stomach growls in emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know for certain when we experience suffering, with our own subjective intangible metrics. Certain lines we cross that our mind tells us “Stop!”. And this threshold changes and varies with so many external factors. Your boss compared to your friend. 8 hours of sleep compared to 3 hours of sleep. An empty stomach compared to a ravanous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to ourselves, for which we supposedly know best, cannot concretely define our own suffering, how then do we know for certain if another person is in a state of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see a person in a wheelchair, a disabled person with no arms or even a person without a home, and we immediately think of them as suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are they really suffering subjectively? Or do we assume that they are suffering because they do not fit into our ideal visions of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He must be suffering because he is in a wheelchair, and is unable to walk and run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She must be suffering because she has no home and family to live with”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we project our beliefs of happiness onto them, and if they do not match any of them, we instinctively think that they are suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a man with no arms suffering, if he has become at peace with it, and lives his life to the fullest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about a man with two functional arms, but with a troubled mind that wears him down everyday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because we do not see the troubled mind, we have no projections of suffering, and we do not emphatize as much. That is the neglect depression suffers endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This projection ultimately originates from ourselves. How we define how happiness should be achieved influences how much suffering we see other people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple man sees a simple world, with happiness defined simply. He thus sees less suffering, because the simplest of events matches his views of attaining peace. Being able to eat a meal. Having a shelter over your head. Having a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demanding man demands much from the world, with happiness defined complexly. He sees the most suffering, because it is so hard for him to be happy, and no one else should be. You must have a car. You must be earning a certain amount of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that there is no suffering. War, famine and death are very real sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True sufferings are the ones that we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projected sufferings are the ones that don’t fit to our vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, true sufferings or projected sufferings, we must strive to eliminate or at least mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Shadow Goodness and Badness</title><link href="/shadow-goodness-and-badness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-23T14:06:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-23T14:06:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-12-23:/shadow-goodness-and-badness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The Shadow, a concept taken from a book I read, is a hidden part of our subconciousness.

It works from the shadows, influencing our actions, our thoughts and our speech. All these happens, unknowing to us, while we are still left thinking we have full control of everything about us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These Shadows, which as I will explain later, does not necessarily mean it is evil, as the name "Shadow" seems to suggest. Rather, it is like how shadow is formed by the abscence of light, the Shadow consciousness lurks in the abscence of awareness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are formed by experiences and memories of previous situations we encountered. These reflexes that we learned and adaptations that we took form over time train our subconcious to apply them when faced with a similar situation in the future. Our future is therefore binded tightly to our past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So where does the distinction between the Good Shadow and the Bad Shadow come from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To begin right from the start, we are all born with inherent goodness. No one taught us to love, yet we know how to. No training was done to teach us how to seek and give love. No conditioning was done to make it feel right to do good unto others. We are born with goodness, but we are unaware of it. The inherent Shadow Goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where does the Shadow Badness come from? Notice I did not use the word "inherent" to describe this bad Shadow. It is not inherent, it is a function of the attentiveness and nourishment towards the Shadow Goodness. The lesser goodness we experience, the more room the Shadow badness occupies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When we were neglected as children, the goodness of recieving love is neglected, and this trains and conditions the soul to reject love, as if it was a norm. We adapt to the lack of love and guard ourselves against it. We learn the reflexes of not recieving love, and we allow the Shadow of badness to seep in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As evil exists in the abscence of good, shadow in the abscence of light, cold in the abscence heat, the Shadow of Badness grows in the abscence of the Shadow of Goodness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to reconcile with, and to heal the hurtful bad Shadow, is thus then to reinforce the good Shadow, the good unconscious. To nourish what is inherent in us, to feed the soul we were born with. Through mindful good thoughts, actions and speech in the conscious space, the subconscious learns these reflexes and adaptations to love. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It becomes accustom to give and recieve love, as we were born with the ability to do so right from the start.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Religious again?</title><link href="/religious-again.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-12-11T10:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-12-11T10:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-12-11:/religious-again.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Should I go back to being religious?

It seems like I have strayed away from the person I sought myself to be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After doing away with religion, I have fallen back on pure logic. Pure naturalistic logic, while at the same time compromising on abstracted morals related to certain actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With no rules, I have taken the bottom up approach, as mentioned in my previous post. My actions are guided from what I think is right, and then I go on to mould and reshape my beliefs to justify them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But now I feel that something is wrong. I feel wrong inside. It feels.. unnatural. Ironic, since they are guided by natural instincts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I wish to take the Top-down view of things, the return to religion, it would be optimal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The issue here is: the reason I am going back to religion is not because I believe in it. It is not because I fear the consequnces of being a non-believer, but only because it grounds me, and gives me a base, one that I initially sought without religion to much apparent failure, to guide my thoughts and actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, I am being religious not for a religous purpose, but for a moral purpose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Which religion should I choose? Prime consideration would be one that has believes I subcribe to. Secondary consideration would be that it has a support group who shares the same spiritual (not religious) belief as I do. Other considerations include doing away with idols and rituals, a non-conformist approach to show devotion, and one that gives me sufficient solace.&lt;/p&gt;

The view that it is all about suffering, the view that it is about maximizing pleasure or the view that it has no meaning at all. And these are all perfectly valid views because they come from a collective subjective experience. You can't say it is definitely wrong, because the person has a life as well, and with that, he has every right to see how it is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But I would like to focus on two views on life&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Top-down view: This view says we first believe in a higher abstracted meaning, and all subsequent actions are justified and adjusted to fulfil that meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Bottom-up view: This view says we still have an abstracted belief, but how we attain it is guided through our actions. In this view, the belief can be modified and changed in order to justify actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this case, it is best if we all took the Top-down view of things. A Bottom-up view allows you to morph and conjure lies to mask the belief in order to suit your liking. This gives a very dubious and unreliable compass to guide us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Top-down approach on the other hand gives us a staunch and firm ground for us to anchor of decisions and actions on. And all consequential outcomes can be drawn back to a common belief it was derived from, giving us an objective assessment of the belief we were holding. Therefore, if the outcomes were undesirable, either we stop the action, or rebase our beliefs.

&lt;p&gt;Water flows; to give life; to create; to quench a thirst; to show beauty.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To destroy; to drown; to wash away; to drench a man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does your water flow for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is your life for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How you direct your energy of life, decides how you impact those around you. How you decide to lead your life, impacts all those around you. To what morals you align your life to, influences things around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water doesn't have any meaning. There is no tangible reality which water emulates to give it meaning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thing that do have meaning, sees itself as a comparison of likeliness to another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Smiling means happiness. Frowning means sadness. Banging your fist on the table means anger. Running away means fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water means?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what water lacks in meaning, it compensates with purpose, beneficial or destructive, it has no preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, life has no meaning then. For what tangible emulations does life exhibit? What understandable experience can we fit life into? When all possible tangible emulations are contained within, and arises from life, finding a comparison would be illogical.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, like water, life compensates the lack of meaning with purpose, which too has no preference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While life then has no preference of a beneficial or destructive purpose, it is guided by the desires of man. And it is here that social dynamics takes place, with our best efforts to achieve what is beneficial to everyone. A rare few have their desires guided towards destruction, and it is those we condemn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, putting it shortly: Life is driven by beneficial purposes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits for others.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits for self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benefits, being entirely qualitative, I shall not attempt to delve into.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps then, we should stop asking "What is the meaning of life", for as explained earlier, it is a paradox to caricaturize a thing in itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead, we should be asking "What is the purpose of my life". And it is with a strong desire that I hope it is a beneficial one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And just as the first drops of water taste the sweetest, despite the lack of taste. Just as the first gush of it is filled with rejuvenation, it slowly turns stale.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It starts to be a bother. Bloated, over-hydrated. The mouth accustomed to the taste sips it in disdain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life then, is also the sweetest at its inception. The burst of youth and ideas. The jovial experiences. The endearing curiosity of the young man.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It slows, becomes a burden. The familiarity brings with it disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So enjoy the initial taste, for it only comes once.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after the bottle is empty, it may be refilled*.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But those are not for you anymore,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For you had your fill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(* I say this because I do have certain spiritual inclinations. For the non-spiritual, you can view it as new life being brought to earth)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Goals, and how to make one</title><link href="/goals-and-how-to-make-one.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-21T01:14:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-21T01:14:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-10-21:/goals-and-how-to-make-one.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If the essence of life has inherent positivity, then there would be no such thing as boredom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just by mere existence, would bring about satisfaction and content. Just by being, will suffice. But that is never the case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We get bored, and we feel valueless when we merely exist. The meaning of life has no meaning in just being, and so we seek out to do.We set goals to strive for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goals that are difficult and distance, of which those properties gives us a belief that there would be satisfaction in the end. The harder the goal, the more hope it gives us that happiness can be attained. The more complex and distant the goal, the more we can justify ourselves for being satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are some people, undoubtly, relish in boredom. They do not see a need to strive for a goal, and are satisfied being bored. This aimlessness, I consider a plauge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By setting goals that are too easily achieveable, it poses no challenge to us, and gives us little satisfaction. And even if we set a longer and harder goal, there will still be no guarantee it will give us satisfaction when we finally reach it. An unfazed graduate who finished his years of education. A disgruntled super car owner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the premise here is that when we set goals, it gives us hope and optimism that it will lead to satisfaction. The strategy here is to set a goal that is impossible to quantify. A goal that is larger than yourself. Abiding by morals, devoting to a religion, patrotism to your country, living for others. And because these are not quantifiable, there will always be hope granted by these goals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as we derive such hopefulness from our goals, we become satisfied with life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*(A distinction must be made here between short term goals, and lifelong goals. Short term goals are still practical and necessary. But we must be cautious on what we place our finger on our lifelong goals)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Live for today, live for the future</title><link href="/live-for-today-live-for-the-future.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-20T13:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-20T13:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-10-20:/live-for-today-live-for-the-future.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no point in living in the future, if you're not living for today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We've been told to plan and envision where we want to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;There is no point in living in the future, if you're not living for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been sold a belief that there is some goal in the future that we must toil for today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We've been told to plan and envision where we want to be in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So much emphasis has been placed on something that is just as intangible as the past.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And when, we finally reach the "future" we've planned for, that's not the end! There is still a next set of futures, and next set of futures, until there comes a day where we must plan our death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this emphasis on the future, we are never really "there", but instead, placed through phases of life that are out of sync, which are always one frame in front of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Planning for the future is important, but how are you to plan for whats ahead, if you don't know what you have now!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What point is there to read a map, if your current coordinates are a blur.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Live for today! Live for the present!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The future is but a fantasy, a malleable entity shaped by your choices. Choices that you make in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of frolicking in the future that never seems to come, seize the present, and in it you have the power to make choices to shape the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you live for the present?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simply be aware of the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your words.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your surroundings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immerse yourself into these immediate entities, and soak in the present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These things will never be experienced in the fantasy of the future, but only now.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Subjectivity of Suffering.</title><link href="/the-subjectivity-of-suffering.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-10T14:04:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-10T14:04:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-10-10:/the-subjectivity-of-suffering.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;So i wrote a piece for one of my friend.

&lt;p&gt;We know that we …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So i wrote a piece for one of my friend. Initally it had some religious context, but then we spoke about something more general on Suffering:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do we come to conclude that a certain event, or despairing predicament a person is in amounts to suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that we are suffering if we feel a certain amount of personal discomfort. The Sun is beating down on your exposed skin. Your legs weary from standing. Your heart aches from a sour relationship. Your stomach growls in emptiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know for certain when we experience suffering, with our own subjective intangible metrics. Certain lines we cross that our mind tells us “Stop!”. And this threshold changes and varies with so many external factors. Your boss compared to your friend. 8 hours of sleep compared to 3 hours of sleep. An empty stomach compared to a ravanous one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even to ourselves, for which we supposedly know best, cannot concretely define our own suffering, how then do we know for certain if another person is in a state of suffering?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We see a person in a wheelchair, a disabled person with no arms or even a person without a home, and we immediately think of them as suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But are they really suffering subjectively? Or do we assume that they are suffering because they do not fit into our ideal visions of happiness?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“He must be suffering because he is in a wheelchair, and is unable to walk and run.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“She must be suffering because she has no home and family to live with”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we project our beliefs of happiness onto them, and if they do not match any of them, we instinctively think that they are suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Is a man with no arms suffering, if he has become at peace with it, and lives his life to the fullest?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What about a man with two functional arms, but with a troubled mind that wears him down everyday?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And because we do not see the troubled mind, we have no projections of suffering, and we do not emphatize as much. That is the neglect depression suffers endure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This projection ultimately originates from ourselves. How we define how happiness should be achieved influences how much suffering we see other people have.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A simple man sees a simple world, with happiness defined simply. He thus sees less suffering, because the simplest of events matches his views of attaining peace. Being able to eat a meal. Having a shelter over your head. Having a friend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A demanding man demands much from the world, with happiness defined complexly. He sees the most suffering, because it is so hard for him to be happy, and no one else should be. You must have a car. You must be earning a certain amount of income.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am not saying that there is no suffering. War, famine and death are very real sufferings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True sufferings are the ones that we can all relate to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Projected sufferings are the ones that don’t fit to our vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That being said, true sufferings or projected sufferings, we must strive to eliminate or at least mitigate them.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>What should be learnt</title><link href="/what-should-be-learnt.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-10-09T14:55:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-10-09T14:55:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-10-09:/what-should-be-learnt.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Life is but a tiny room.

We can't fit a lot in it, so we have to be prudent to choose what we pick to put in the room.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe that technical skills, while important for one to earn his keep and prove his worth, possibly even grow a passion for, should only be considered a tradecraft. A skill to function as a useful person in society.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, while we focus much on honing our techincal prowess, we seem to be forgetting a more paramount skill, that of morality, that of widsom, or to cite the 4 virtues, Prudence, Justice, Temperament and Courage.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What good is it that I can control my weights in the gym, but anger controls me so easily. What good is that I can get along with my boss and people at work, but I can't get along with my conscience. What good is it that people look up to me, but i'm not at peace with myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on achieving wisdom, that is life's greatest task, and one which will permeate through your entire life. If you only focus on your technical skills, your achievements will only be tied to the present. Fleeting and transient, but not to say they are not useful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let wisdom be what you seek primarily, while practicing your tradecrafts in idle time, instead of seeking wisdom in idle time. If you do that, you most definitely won't grow wiser, only more skillful.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The layers to happiness</title><link href="/the-layers-to-happiness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-06-05T04:24:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-06-05T04:24:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-06-05:/the-layers-to-happiness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;We always try to find happiness.

We try to seek it, as it were an object to endeavor finding. But what if it wasn't an end goal, but a by product? What if it was like a shadow, only appearing in the absence of light, it only appears in the absence of suffering? If that were the case, then just as we need to find the light that creates the shadow, we need to find the sufferings to remove, in order to create happiness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here I would explore ideas that read, which pinpoints human suffering to the struggling definition of oneself. Who am I, and what am I here for?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;I am what I have&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In this view, we wrongly define ourselves as our material possessions. The more we own, the more we think we are elevated in societies ranks. The pursuit of wealth and material items, which like a drug, only temporarily satiates the greed of the soul, and more importantly, it know satiates your own soul. It is a selfish and blind endeavour to pursue materials in order to seek definition of oneself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You would constantly be caught in a never ending cycle of materialism, and the need to own more as old possessions lose their value. This gives rise to anxiety, something which we wish to disassociate ourselves from.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;I am what I do&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
While this definition is not as malevolent as the materialistic one, it seems to have misguided many to believe that in order to be productive, I have to be doing something, no matter what it is. We have been convinced to demonise idle time, and we're always looking for something to fill up our time with "stuff" to do. And even if we do not enjoy the things we do, we are deluded into thinking that regardless of enjoyment, the act of nonidleness is a virtue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We soldier on, always looking for things to busy our mind, to distract us from the existential crisis we choose to ignore. We get lost in work, and when we snap out of it, we get a false sense of satisfaction. This gives rise to frustration. On an idle weekend, one would beat themselves up for being "unproductive". We struggle to find mindless activities to pass time, or rather, to waste time. Such a struggle is uncalled for, and doing something for the sake of doing it to feel productive is a false lie we must stop believing in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;u&gt;I am what I am&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
In the previous 2 definitions, we saw the definition of self from a materialistic perspective, and a narcissistic perspective. This final definition, and the one I believe is the most accurate one, seeks to define a person from within. Not from external powers such as owning materials and pseudo-productive activities. The ultimate aim of us all is to grow and flourish optimally, bounded within the constrains given the situation you are in. This aim should be our definition of ourselves. Do not seek to own more than you want. Do not seek to do more than you want. Own what you will. Do what you will. This is the optimal state for each of us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Frustation and anxiety arises when we struggle to own more than we want,  and do more than we want. And we do so because we are wrongly defining ourselves by the first two views. We become torn out from our basic nature,  and wrongly seek validation from the outside. Return back to your innerself. Return back to your basic nature. Who are you?&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Five actions for happiness (To others and yourself)</title><link href="/five-actions-for-happiness-to-others-and-yourself.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-19T11:16:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-19T11:16:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-19:/five-actions-for-happiness-to-others-and-yourself.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;G.R.E.A.T&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Giving is the greatest way to achieve happiness, both to the receiver and yourself. Giving can be done in many ways, such as money, words, and even time. By giving something you have to another person, it makes everyone a little bit happier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Relate&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Relating and connecting to someone makes the person feel cared for and loved. We humans are social creatures and we desire attention. By relating to someone and making them know we (genuinely) care about them, it makes them happier, and in turn, it makes us happy, because we care about them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Exercise&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does it improve your physical health, it also improves your mental health. You gain more confidence, and you learn to push your boundaries and break plateaus. A good exercise challenges you both physical and mentally&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Appreciate&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gratitude. Instead of focusing on what you don't have and your weaknesses, appreciate what you already have, and your strengths. Acknowledge your achievements, and allow that to propel you forward to achieve even more. If you are constantly looking at the gap between what you have and what you want, you're forever stuck in a negative cycle of discontentment. Instead, take time to look back, and let it empower you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Teach yourself&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn new skills every now and then, be it technical skills or people skills. Research well into your profession and learn new things to increase your proficiency. Learn from situations, from people, and from yourself (What pulls your strings? What motivates you? What do you like?).&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Why I work</title><link href="/why-i-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-18T15:48:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-18T15:48:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-18:/why-i-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading this book (still in progress) called Happiness by Richard Layard, it got me thinking on the subject i've been bothered for quite some time now: Why do we work?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few simple points i've gathered:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are a few simple points i've gathered:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work to be a useful contributing member of the society. I find meaning in work that I am doing my part to ensure the proper functioning of the society I am living in.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work to gain social status. As a programmer, to be labeled as one, gives me a sense of ingenuity. To feel like I am achieving something, and for personal satisfaction that the work I am engaged in is professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I work for financial stability. To survive in the world, as well as to indulge slightly in the material joys of it. But I have to be cautious not to fall into this trap of overindulgence of material goods, for they only bring about temporary satisfaction. (Much like how you treasure your new phone on the 1st week, but throwing it on the table by the 5th.)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As I wrote in my previous post, work, at least where I am right now, is an intractable reality, therefore my expectations towards it should be managed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will not gain immense joy from it, but I should not be suffering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can however, approach the challenges positively, knowing that every hurdle I overcome does a few thing:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;a) It improves the overall functioning of my company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;b) It allows me to learn and pick up new skills.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I should therefore focus on these things to gain a more positive attitude.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just got an idea. I should buy a notebook (I already have so many... But this is one of the material indulgence), and write down what challenges I face everyday, and how I have overcome them, and also what I have learnt from it.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Hemorrhoidectomy</title><link href="/hemorrhoidectomy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-18T15:20:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-18T15:20:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-18:/hemorrhoidectomy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Ive always had trouble spelling that word, but after going through it last Sunday (10th April), i've been searching up and reading about it so much, especially the recovery period.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I'm writing this posts now, because i've been inspired by all other posts by people who have gone through hemorrhoidectomy, and the tips they provide. I feel like i'm passing the flame down. Also, for people suffering hemorrhoids in silence, please do not feel shy about it, and consult a doctor if it starts bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Background&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been suffering from hemorrhoids for quite awhile now, probably about close to a year. It was one small tiny hemorrhoid that prolapsed whenever i took a dump, but it never really bothered me at all. Every time i wiped my butt, there was blood, but i took it as nothing, and simply pushed the piles back in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Until one day, it started to bleed really badly. Blood was dripping non-stop, and the entire toilet bowl was filled with blood. When i stood up, blood was dripping my butt. Obviously this prompted me to go to a hospital (Parkway East) to visit a doctor (Dr Imran Nawaz) immediately, and a surgery was schedule the following day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Day before surgery&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Doctor told me not to consume any food, and only to drink clear liquid. I was set to do a colonoscopy, and a &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;HEMORRHOIDECTOMY.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; Those words still scare me. I was given a bottle of "Fleet" to drink, which was oral sodium phosphate. Basically, it drains water from your body, and flushes the colon out clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Worst. Night. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every 20 mins, i was rushing to the toilet to let out jets of water out from my butt. I could hardly catch any sleep, even up till 4am. At 5:30am, a nurse came in to give me another half dosage. My surgery was scheduled to be at 9:00am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Day of surgery&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was pretty calm about it. Joking and jesting with the nurses who brought me in to the surgery room (Su, Joseph and Al). It all happened to fast. I was given anesthesia, and fell straight to sleep, and the operation was performed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[After surgery]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I woke up at about 1030am, and was still a little drowsy from the drugs. I was repeating whatever i heard from the nurses, and mimicking them. I was also telling jokes to the nurses, probably disturbing them working. Kinda embarrassing come to think of it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was to stay in the hospital for one more night for the nurses and doctor to check my wound, in case there was any sudden bleeding, or if i felt unwell. I was promptly discharged the next day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Day 1 -5 Post surgery&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can say i've never ever felt so much pain and discomfort in my life. I never knew this sort of pain was possible to a human. (Okay a little exaggerated.) Every time i had to poop, i was sweating, and my toes were clenched. I would be gritting my teeth and grabbing the walls because of the immense pain. Horrible horrible experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After every poop i had to take a warm bath to calm myself down, and i also had to take a sitz bath, which really helped a lot with the swelling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was constipated once, and it was so bad. Note to readers: Do not get constipated. Ever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[Moving on]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Its day 8 now as of writing this post. The pain has subsided immensely, and i can finally see the light of getting healed. Im starting to do light workouts such as squats and pull ups. I can finally sit up to get out of bed, instead of tumbling and rolling over. I can finally poop without feeling im going to faint from the pain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My follow up appointment is on next Monday, and i'm really eager to see how much i've healed by then!&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Digging into happiness</title><link href="/digging-into-happiness.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-04-06T14:05:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-04-06T14:05:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-04-06:/digging-into-happiness.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I realized that i am writing lesser now. lt appears thet somehow I find it to be a chore.

Perhaps I will start writing shorter paragraphs, and more spontaneous posts. Something like tweets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These few days I have been thinking about happiness, probably due to my new job. After digging around and picking my brain, heres what I came up with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It all starts with dissatisfaction, an unhappiness of sorts towards something, someone or and event. We dislike the process. We dislike the outcome. We dislike our involvement in it. But where does this unhappiness stem from?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It comes from the mismatch between &lt;strong&gt;reality&lt;/strong&gt; and our &lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;. We desire for things to go smoothly, for our jobs not to suck, for a loving relationship, for trusting friends. But most of the time, reality is not so kind towards us, and presents us with situations that are often misaligned with our desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, to get satisfaction and happiness, these reality and desires must be aligned. There are two things you can do here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Put in effort and work hard, so that the &lt;strong&gt;realities&lt;/strong&gt; shape into your &lt;strong&gt;desires&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You want a good body, you want good grades in school, you want to make money. These things can be actualized through hardwork and effort. These realities can be formed and moulded into your desires. Lets call them &lt;strong&gt;malleable realities&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) Recognize that no amount of hardwork and effort can change reality, and change your desires to accept reality, and the beauty of it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The world is in a mess, world hunger and global warming plauges us. Your stubborn boss bites at you at every chance. No matter what you do, you cannot change reality. And your desires can never be met. Lets call these &lt;strong&gt;intractable realities&lt;/strong&gt;. They cannot be controlled or directed by your effort, so let them be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The key here is to understand which realities are malleable, and which are intractable. By correctly classifying realities, you can then direct your effort to the right places.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is much disappointment to be met, when you direct huge effort to an intractable reality. There is much satisfaction to be obtained, when you mould the malleable realities with effort to match your desires.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for me now, my job seems... like an intractable reality. I can either change my desires and expectations of the job, or mould reality, and find another that meets my desires.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The stresses at work</title><link href="/the-stresses-at-work.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-03-08T15:25:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-03-08T15:25:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-03-08:/the-stresses-at-work.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Does it motivate me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No. No. No.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm currently reading up on the tradeoffs for high-paying high-stress job, for a low-paying low-stress job.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Will I be willing to take the pay cut?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the same time, i'm starting to discover myself more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Working under deadlines, having to face multiple bosses, a dreaded 8:15 - 17:45 lifestyle (The only time I see the sun is during my lunch break). Do I enjoy this lifestyle?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Maybe not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After hearing a respected speaker for Staff Working say this phrase: "That's where my youth went to." It makes me afraid.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't like it here, but will I be willing to take the jump?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is probably my first crossroad as an adult, where I have to make a mature decision. One that will alter the course of my life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's one of the many crossroads I will face, and I hope I make the wise decision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will definitely be an experience.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Gusto for life</title><link href="/the-gusto-for-life.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2016-02-09T10:31:00+00:00</published><updated>2016-02-09T10:31:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2016-02-09:/the-gusto-for-life.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;How do you stay motivated in life?

Occasionally it gives you a flower and a lovely sight, but most of the time, believe me you, you'll be in a shit hole. So how does one stay positive in such a situation?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well here are a few things we know:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Life's a bitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're a motherfucking badass.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Badasses don't take shit from a bitch.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Badasses fuck bitches up.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, we fuck shit up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="dfdcc5ac07ad9de7f5c5f360e878ae330d83b52a7d10b99f120211f8738a51e3" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-307" height="330" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/dfdcc5ac07ad9de7f5c5f360e878ae330d83b52a7d10b99f120211f8738a51e3.jpg" width="440"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, now we have our actions on what badasses like us do, lets revisit our predicament again: &lt;strong&gt;We're in a shit hole called life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's hard to succeed in life, and entirely up to luck. Given the current world population and wealth distribution, you're statistically more likely to be born in a place where you're almost going to fail (as defined from a purely societal construct). So how do we fuck this plan life has for us? A plan for suffering and failure, a plan for destitute and agony? Simple: We point our middle fingers at it, and proceed to &lt;strong&gt;Succeed the shit out of life &lt;/strong&gt; like the rebels we are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anarchy!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chaos!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Life's plan is so hard, it's so easy and normal to just fail. We accept failure. We're told to accept failure. Fuck that. Succeed at all cost. (within legal and moral limits). Fuck life up not by drugs. Doing drugs is easy. Fuck life up by succeeding, because that's life on hard mode.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently finished reading this book by Anthony Robbins, called Unlimited Power. It teaches a lot of personal mastery techniques which, surprisingly to my highly skeptical nature, actually works!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are a few high level abstractions of the lessons he taught:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Changing your internal representation:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This lesson was really interesting, because all of us already have internal representations of things, events and people. Also, when new experiences come in, when we meet new people, we form representations of them based on our &lt;strong&gt;previous&lt;/strong&gt; experiences and &lt;strong&gt;prior&lt;/strong&gt; internal representations. So this thing about internal representations is actually really power, thus, knowing how to control it, and tweak it to have &lt;strong&gt;positive&lt;/strong&gt; internal representation of certain things would be immensely helpful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Example:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I dislike my work. I feel that work stressed me out. At the end of the day, I feel extremely tired and unfruitful." For the most of us, that is our current internal representation. So when we go to work, we are casting a &lt;strong&gt;brand new day&lt;/strong&gt; into this negative internal representation. By breaking this internal representation and casting it into a &lt;strong&gt;positive internal representation&lt;/strong&gt;, we will be able to face our challenges in a new way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;
2.  [Pattern Breaking:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creatures of habit. When we do something, it is mostly likely because it is a habit. This action can be brought over from other events, as the habit is a manifestation of your inner psychology. You over-eat, you over-sleep, you over-do-stuff. This pattern repeats itself over and over again, each time &lt;strong&gt;reinforcing&lt;/strong&gt; this pattern, strengthening the connections within your brain that you &lt;strong&gt;must &lt;/strong&gt;do some actions, when presented with a certain situation. To break this negative cycle, we have to perform &lt;strong&gt;pattern breaking&lt;/strong&gt;. Its pretty simple: confuse the mind. Form new neurological paths when presented with this situation. Do something you've never done before when you face a common vice. Do something &lt;strong&gt;REALLY&lt;/strong&gt; powerful and weird to shock the brain. Feel like smoking? Throw the cigarette on the floor and do a Haka dance and smash it all up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[Example:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I'm always feeling sad. When I feel sad, I feel even more helpless and sadder that I can't do anything about it. I feel depressed I can't cheer up." Caught in this cycle? Burst out into laughter. Do a cheerful crazy dance. Go out and sprint as hard and fast as you can, and smile while doing it. These things break the pattern of spiralling sadness. (True story)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;
3.  [How to identify a personality:]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What I feel is the most important lesson from this book, the seven indicators to identify a personality. There won't be any examples for this one because they are pretty self explanatory. Here they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you moving towards, or moving away?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you perform an action, do you do it because you want to avoid something, or because you want to achieve something? Do you work because you want to grow as a person, or do you wish to avoid living in poverty?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you have a strong internal or external frame of reference?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How much weight do you put on other people's words? How much weight do you put on your words? If someone said you did a bad job, but you felt you did amazing, would he affect your judgement?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you sort by self or sort by others?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How oriented are your actions towards to others? Do you do things for the betterment of the group? Or do actions always have to have some form of personal gain?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a matcher or a mis-matcher?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first see two objects/people, do you first identify their similarities, or their differences? Do you find what contrasts them, or how do they complement each other?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What does it take to convince you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If I told you someone was good at something, what does it take to convince you? Do you have to see him perform it yourself? If so, how many times does he have to do it in-front you before you conclude he is really good at it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you seek possibilities or necessities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you find possibilities in your work and life, or do you find necessities? Are you exploratory and find creative means to live your life, or are you satiated with the bare minimum of necessities?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you independent or a group worker?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you like working alone, or in a group? Do you prefer to make your own decisions, or get another person's assurance before doing something? This could be a hybrid, where you get advice from people, but you end up doing the actual work yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p style="padding-left:30px;"&gt;

&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay, that's all the lessons I can remember, or bother to type out. It's a really good book if you wish to explore yourself more. These books usually sell themselves as you suddenly being able to break out into a marvellous new person. Not a chance. But there are some golden nuggets there you can pick out, and these are the few I picked :)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The I in Me</title><link href="/the-i-in-i.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-12-20T13:59:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-12-20T13:59:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-12-20:/the-i-in-i.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Okay, i think i'm gonna update my blog more often now.

And by more often i mean at least once a month. I find i always have all these thoughts in my mind that makes me question many things, but after i get home and play a few rounds of DOTA, i instantly forget them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, the topic i thought about today while cycling was the concept of I. Me. Self. So i within my own reasoning and thought process, i came up with this high level abstraction:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Capture" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" height="462" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/capture.png" width="654"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So we have the overarching "I", which is just a word thrown around in conversations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It then splits down into two "I"s, the "I" in relation to others, and the "I" in relation to self.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;"I" in relation to others&lt;/strong&gt;]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a tree falls in the forest, and nobody hears it fall, does it make a sound?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm going to give my own answer here and say: No. (Spare me the philosophical arguments, i'm making another point here)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So why doesn't it make a sound? Because no one is there to observe it fall. No one is there to internalize the vision and the sound of a falling tree. No one &lt;strong&gt;experiences&lt;/strong&gt; it. And i think that's the crux of the issue, the human experience of things that makes things "exists"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, if a human lives on earth, and it impact no one at all, does it still exist?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again from my own argument:No! It may be a living thing going about its daily life, but if it doesn't impact others, and doesn't create &lt;strong&gt;positive experiences &lt;/strong&gt;for others, then it's existence is insignificant. Note that i emphasized on positive, for if it were negative, people would wish we never existed in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this argument, i'm &lt;strong&gt;not&lt;/strong&gt; saying that unless we make an incredibly huge impact like Bill Gates or Ghandi, we're non-existent. As long as we impact the people around us in our daily lives in a positive way, we are existing wholly and fully. As long as we always create positive experiences for others, we will forever exist in the impermanence of their memories, no matter the fate of our physical bodies. Here's a nice post written by Frank Yang on our own self value on our own life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;https://www.instagram.com/p/-xJmQGkJO2/?taken-by=being_frank_yang&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is how the "I" in relation to others arises to existence. Through our deeds and actions that impact them. Our birth is significant, because of what lies ahead of us. Our death is significant, because of what lies behind us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;[The "I" in relation to self]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "I" in relation to self splits off into two areas: the "I", and the self. Is there a difference? From what i thought of, yes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The "I" that we hold to ourselves the inner self that we use to interact with the outerworld. "I" am feeling hungry. "I" am feeling tired. "I" am feeling stressed. This "I" is highly reactive to the surroundings, and is very primitive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Self however, is something deeper. It's where your morals and values reside. These things are less reactive, and are likely to stay the same regardless of the environment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our focus should therefore lie on the Self, and not the malleable "I". We have to build our inner foundation and strengthen it to live as a person with morals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At times we act on the "I", which receives inputs from the external world, and this causes a conflict with our Self. Therein arises guilt and remorse. As the saying goes&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Check your&lt;strong&gt;SELF"&lt;/strong&gt;. Which means before you act on the highly reactive "I", you need to take a step back and understand that the "I" is dynamic. Check on your Self. Does it conflict with the inner Self?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, the "I" is not all bad. I think this "I" could represent the gut feeling, which is sometimes a good thing to act upon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alright that's all the arguments and theories I thought about today. Until the next time i start thinking about stuff again.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Long term goals and Short term decision dichotomy</title><link href="/long-term-goals-and-short-term-decision-dichotomy.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-09-06T05:43:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-09-06T05:43:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-09-06:/long-term-goals-and-short-term-decision-dichotomy.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;When we talk about goal setting, we have our Long term goals that we want to achieve within a certain period of time.

The long term goal achievement rate is highly correlated to our short term decision making. However, &lt;strong&gt;the persistent separation of these 2 items can have detrimental effects on you achieving your goals as a whole&lt;/strong&gt;. We should therefore align our short term decision making with our long term goals, and in this way, they both complement each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A long term goal would be something you want to achieve in 10 years, or 20 years time. These could be things like saving for retirement, buying a house or a car, or saving for you children's education. A long term goal can also lie within a year, where the goal is to get healthy, or achieve good grades in their final exams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Short term decisions are tiny milestones we have that bring us closer towards the long term goal. They could be things like choosing your meals for the day, deciding on what to buy. The devil lies in the short term decision making, because we are influenced by many factors that will cloud our decision. The main game-breaker is the feeling of instant gratification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say we have a goal to lose weight within the next year. The goal set has been &lt;strong&gt;Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, and Time-bound (SMART framework)&lt;/strong&gt;, and all is set for you to go and achieve it. From now till the next year, countless of decisions will be made, many of which will affect the success factor of the long term goal. Of which they are things like should I head out for an exercise today because the weather is too hot? Should I eat fast-food because the canteen is too crowded? Should I skip a meal because there is too much work to do? As we start to allow instant gratification to influence our short term decision making, it starts to accumulate and fester, and soon enough, you will forget the goal you had in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The way to overcome and &lt;strong&gt;block out instant gratification from clouding our short term decision making, is to use short term reasoning&lt;/strong&gt;. We can always reason to ourselves that a fast food today won't hurt, skipping just one running session won't do any harm, or sleeping in for a day is perfectly fine. These will lead to the brain learning the behavior of "Oh, I skipped running last week, and it felt perfectly fine, therefore skipping it this week would be absolutely fine as well." Here, instant gratification of "feeling perfectly fine" clouds our decision making.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We should start to reason in ways that are aligned with our long term goal. Do not reason to yourself that "Skipping a run will make me feel comfortable at home", or "eating fast-food is convenient due to the crowd". These are thoughts of instant gratification. Instead, reason to yourself that "Running will clear my mind, and make me feel refreshed throughout the day", or "eating fast food will lead me to feel extremely tired and groggy later on, due to the high fat content," "Drinking a can of sugar drink will lead me to have a sugar crash later on in the day". &lt;strong&gt;These short term reasons and short term incentives are aligned with your long term goal of losing weight&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of having the mentality that doing the right thing is hard, "Buying a salad is expensive","running takes up time and it's hot","eating the right food is difficult to choose", we should change our thinking entirely, such that doing the right thing is perfectly reasonable. "Buying a salad is healthy and keeps me refreshed","Running clears up my mind and allows me to destress","eating the right food is cheaper than fast food". If we constantly think that the right thing to do is hard, and we have to come up with reasons to do it, our brain will eventually think that doing the right thing is wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, &lt;strong&gt;we should not think of reasons why, but reasons why not&lt;/strong&gt;. If we change our short term decision making by removing instant gratification with positive reasoning, we will be on the right track. &lt;strong&gt;Come up with short term incentives to entice the brain to do the right thing&lt;/strong&gt;. If we allow instant gratification to influence our short term decisions, and we come up with reasons not to do it, we will eventually fail.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Three pins to two holes</title><link href="/three-pins-to-two-holes.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-11T17:19:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-11T17:19:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-05-11:/three-pins-to-two-holes.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Know that this world was not made to accomodate you.

Not everyone will like you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reality is truely different from how we wish it to be, and often it can be hurting. We may feel agitated, regret, and anger, but we must always remember, we were born out of the circumstances of the world, and we are subjects to these circumstances. We may try to control it and manipulate it, but in the end, we will lose.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hardest part of it all is acceptance. To accept and humble ourselves that we were wrong in our views. To accept that some of our hopes can never be realized. To accept that we are wrong, and no matter how much effort we put in, we must accept that there is a possibility of it have no result. That is what we must accept. No amount of motivation or determination will allow you to achieve everything that you want. If hardwork and determination always guaranteed success, then a hardworking mule would be the king of the jungle, instead of the worthy lion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are just like 3 pin plugs, and not all sockets in the world have 3 holes. We will not be able to fit into every socket, but for those that we do, we must treasure and appreciate dearly. Not all sockets were made for us, and we were not made for all sockets. Trying forcible to fit into a 2 holed socket would only cause nothing but damage. You would never succeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe the greatest lie told to mankind was that you would always succeed if you put in effort. That is why we have so many people who cannot accept rejection and failure. Instead, we must teach the people that rejection is part of life, and it is only through rejection that we know our place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are creatures of failure, but it is imperative that we fail, for it is where we learn the grratest lessons from.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>"Finding meaning and purpose in our lives -- importance of hope and idealism" Seeing more in others</title><link href="/finding-meaning-and-purpose-in-our-lives-importance-of-hope-and-idealism-seeing-more-in-others.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-05-11T04:35:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-05-11T04:35:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-05-11:/finding-meaning-and-purpose-in-our-lives-importance-of-hope-and-idealism-seeing-more-in-others.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;https://youtu.be/p9sMoRUJQGA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I find this video holding a lot of truth to it. It says that if we see someone for who they actually are, we are not doing justice to them. We are taking them merely at face value, which holds very little information or moral description. If we take someone only for who they are, be it physically or merely by their occupation, we are overlooking the vast complexity of thoughts and potentials in their life. That is to say, if i told you i am a student, and you proceed to form judgements and perspectives solely based on that fact, it would do me absolutely no justice. Like the plane, if we only look straight ahead for who a person is, we will end up reaching a low level of conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We must therefore take people for more than who they are, more than what we see in them. If we see a student, we must look deeper and appreciate their complexity of life and thoughts. When we do that, we will see who they really are, just like reaching the destination if we look higher to compensate for the crosswinds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This can be said to be not judging a book by its cover, but i think that it covers a broader area which says that, we must proactively assume people to be of a higher value. Once we someone to be greater, it automatically diffuses into their subconscious, and they will feel confident about their skills and character, thus making it a self fulfilling prophecy. If we constantly put someone down and look lowly of them, it will eat away at their soul, making them regress deeper into your negative views.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short; everyone around you is a teacher and greater than what you percieve, and you should make it known to them. (But caution not to make it excessive flattery)&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The separation of Primal wants with Moral needs</title><link href="/the-separation-of-primal-wants-with-moral-needs.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-25T16:12:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-04-25T16:12:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-04-25:/the-separation-of-primal-wants-with-moral-needs.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of me connects with the universe, understanding that the human life is fleeting and insignficant, that life should never be taken so seriously, because in the end, no one remembers the trivial bickerings but your own memory, which disappears with you as you perish in this vast planet floating …&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Part of me connects with the universe, understanding that the human life is fleeting and insignficant, that life should never be taken so seriously, because in the end, no one remembers the trivial bickerings but your own memory, which disappears with you as you perish in this vast planet floating in the eternal abyss of cosmological darkness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cosmological connection i have makes me adopt the attitude of alturism, knowing that since my time is limited, i must be perfection, or at least try to be. I strive for knowledge and justice, for they are the eternal constants in this impermanat world. That is the Moral need that i adopt, because it is a neccesity as a living human. The world has given us life, and we must uphold its sanctity. I love everyone, because everyone suffers the same predicament as me, and not everyone is aware of it. Which brings me to my other self, the Primal wants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Those who indulge in their Primal wants, materialism, mediocre media indulgence, sex and alcohol, petty menial bickerings, fail to see the Moral needs that they need to adopt. And sometimes i indulge in my Primal wants as well, because i am only human. I judge people, i get irritated, i do things of folly, i get emotionally charged and do foolish things that hurt others. And at the end of the day, when i get in touch with my other self, i feel a wave of regret. That is because the Primal wants and Moral needs currently lie in ditchotomy for me. I need to find a way to amalgamate them together as great men did. Where the causes of great men were also their Primal wants, and  not moments of motivation. That is true greatness, and that is what i, and everyone else should strive for. The Primal-Moral essence.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The Self-Competition</title><link href="/the-self-competition.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-04-09T15:46:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-04-09T15:46:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-04-09:/the-self-competition.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The world is absolutely relative.

We find no worth in things, unless it is relative to something else. There needs to be a comparison to show the contrast, to show the greater value over something. Relativity thus requires at least one object in comparison to be the "losing" one in someway or another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we have an abundance of something, with nothing to compare it to, the value will no longer be recognized. It can no longer stand out amongst the mass of substandard goods, and we hold no relativistic value to it. With that in mind, we as humans also hold a certain value. Although it is morally questionable to put down one humans value relative to another, it is done all the time. And in many cases, it is ourselves who perform this relative value assessment through introspection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To us, our worth is measured, broadly classified, in four areas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) Professional&lt;br&gt;
2) Social&lt;br&gt;
3) Spiritual&lt;br&gt;
4) Romance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intersection of these 4 areas collectively leads to the 5th element which we humans value so much: Self-esteem. We hold certain beliefs about ourselves, how good we are, how much we're worth, and how valuable we are to people. But these measurements mean absolutely nothing if measure alone. Without relative measurements of skills, social connections and love, we will never know where we stand, or how good is our good. Therefore, our self-esteem is also measured relativistically with other people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We always seem to be caught in comparison with someone else, and that gives us a certain goal we will work towards. We compare ourselves with the rich, and strive towards their statuses. We compare ourselves with the smart, and work towards their intelligence. We compare ourselves to the less fortunate, and become satisfied with our current situation. But more often than not, we find ourselves unhappy when comparing against others. Even once we reach the desired status, we feel the need to compare ourselves with another higher goal to validate ourselves. It then becomes a never ending cycle of comparison.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are millions of people out there we can compare ourselves to, and we have to realize that comparing and competing with others is inherently toxic. It brings us only temporary joy when we equal or best our reference. It gives us a fleeting moment of bliss, but it quickly disappears and gets consumed by another person to compare with. We become unable to reach a satiated state, but forever trapped in the carrot-chasing limbo of achieving something. Comparison can be healthy in some ways. It motivates us to do something about ourselves, but when there no end in sight, we must break out of the cycle. We must first compare with ourselves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of competing and looking outward towards the world and their achievements, we should first recognize our own achievements, and set to overcome them. We should view our past selves as separate entities to defeat and to overcome, and every day is an opportunity to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physically: Become stronger, healthier and more active. Take care of your body. Eat right, sleep right and be productive in your movements.&lt;br&gt;
Mentally: Become smarter. Become knowledgable. Read areas you have never heard of before. Real about the world and it's history. Read about the great people and learn from them.&lt;br&gt;
Socially: Make more friends. Talk to strangers. Be able to express yourself and your ideas. Reach out to people who need help. Connect with old friends, revitalize existing ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are so many more realms we can cover, and it is up to you to decide which part of you that you wish to overcome. Do not be intimidated by others, for they are not you, nor you they. look inwards. There you will find the most important questions, and only you can come up with the most relevant answers.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="competition"></category><category term="improvement"></category><category term="self"></category></entry><entry><title>Our life is a stage.</title><link href="/our-life-is-a-stage.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-02-15T16:27:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-02-15T16:27:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-02-15:/our-life-is-a-stage.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Our life is a stage.

A play directed and acted by us and us alone. We are the main characters in our play, and all the other people in our lives are calefares. Sure, there are some really important people in your life, like family, friends and lovers. They are not main characters, but important characters that influences how you direct and act out your play. Ultimately, you are in control of everything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Holding that view, we must almost understand that everyone else has their own stages, and in their stage and play, &lt;em&gt;YOU &lt;/em&gt;are the calefare. You may be an important character in some people's play, or you may be a fleeting character, that comes and goes as quick as the wind. It is necessary to understand this, as it gives us a deeper understanding of how and why others act differently, and it is simply because they are in their stage, and you are in yours. Different directors, different settings, different scenarios. Other times, it may also be the &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; person who is confused by your actions, and you must know that perhaps it is because &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; is not in your stage, and therefore you cannot assume he knows the reasons for your actions in entirety.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, as lovers or with people you really care about, you may want to enter their stage as a main character. You may wish to want to stay longer in their stage and act out the important parts in their play. But it is ultimately &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; stage, and some people will let you stay, while others will not, and you &lt;em&gt;MUST&lt;/em&gt; accept their decision, because it is not your stage! We may think and reminisce about the play, just like how we think about a movie we have just watched. But in the end we must move on to our own stage. It is therefore empowering to know that &lt;em&gt;YOU &lt;/em&gt;have that exact same power in your stage. Remove the bad actors! Remove the naysayers! Remove the hecklers! Leave behind only those who appreciate your play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our live should therefore be aimed towards perfecting our play. Making our show as interesting as possible. As lively as possible. The more interesting your show is, the more people will come to watch it. We must focus on our stage, and do our best to create the best scenes. Do not criticize other people's stage. Do not destroy other people's stage, Do not be so bothered in other people's stage that you neglect your own. Tend to your play, because when the curtains fall, people will throw flowers at it, and the curtains will never open again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Life"></category><category term="people"></category><category term="self"></category><category term="society"></category></entry><entry><title>On Governance</title><link href="/on-governance.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2015-01-27T14:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2015-01-27T14:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2015-01-27:/on-governance.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The more incessant the denigration of government and duty, the quicker the domino pieces would fall, with the last and cardinal piece being the very defense of the nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pillars such as economics and social stability will be shaken in the absence of national identity, when you start hearing people saying they would not fight for their own country. Even if the threat of conventional war is minimal in this day and age, the nation must have a certain level of conviction and pride in their own land they were born in. Your parents brought you to the world, and we are grateful for them. So why is it that we are not grateful for the country that brought us up?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is already a substantial amount of hate and anger from the population towards the leaders of this country. We nitpick on trivial issues, shooting the government down at every opportunity we can. Train break downs, fare hikes and other matters that hinder us only slightly are the loudest talking points for the population.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When most of the people scoff at government sector jobs, mocking it as lacking ambition. When people don't understand the notion of purpose towards an ideal, and everything they work on is for personal gain. When people seek not what they can do for the society, but is constantly complaining about and criticizing the system. That is when society begins to become unstable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is constant comparison to the western ideas, and the western policies. I would say that those policies and ideas were made for a liberal country and for liberal minded people. And i would also go another step to say that Singapore is not entirely liberal, but pseudo-liberal. Those policies and ideas would not be effective here.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is missing from us is national pride. How many of us hang the national flag outside our houses on national day? How many of us are able to recite the national anthem? How many of us are truly concerned about the defense of the nation? Most of us are not even remotely proud about our country, and they view Singapore as a stepping stone to a bigger global stage. What this leaves is with is a population looking away from Singapore, even though they are in it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is therefore the duty of the government to instill a national pride into the people. To create a place that we are proud of, and that we want to show off. To move away from the profit making agendas and discover more of the peoples wants and needs. But all of that is not possible only from one side. It takes two hands to clap, and actions from the government alone will not change the society, because the government IS the society. We cannot wrongly view the government as at the top of the ladder, and that all the actions trickle down in a diminishing fashion to the people. That dichotomic view of governance is wrong. The government is not in charge of the people, but they are supposed to be a representative of the people, which leads us to a sad case when the people themselves have no faith in the government, and what is reflected are faithless policies. When the people are greedy and selfish and hateful. When we bicker on unintelligent issues, least to say in an unintelligent way. The people in power are the very same people you sit beside the train. The only difference is our job scope, and maybe much about the pay controversially so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is to say, to even speak of changing the way the government is running, we have to change ourselves first. We have to change our expectations, our selfish way of thinking only about profitability, our bickering about ridiculously trivial things. The people gets the government they deserve. In a corrupted country, you get a corrupted government. In a liberal country, you get a liberal government. And in a money minded country, you get a money minded government. Its is never the case where it is the other way around, where a corrupt government creates a corrupt country. Corrupted officials in Singapore are promptly removed, and that is commendable. It shows that they do not influence the general population to their believes. The only other time this was done was by a man named Adolf Hitler, but even in his case, the people already held steadfast believes that were in tune with his.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therefore, to see a change in the government, we have to change ourselves. If we bring in a government with the perfect ideals, but it conflicts with ours, we would not accept him, and that ultimately defeats the purpose.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="governance"></category><category term="government"></category><category term="society"></category></entry><entry><title>Swimmers Body Illusion.</title><link href="/swimmers-body-illusion.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-05-14T14:13:00+00:00</published><updated>2014-05-14T14:13:00+00:00</updated><author><name>jinhaochan</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-05-14:/swimmers-body-illusion.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are swimmer's body good looking because of their constant swimming activities? Or do they excel in swimming because of their good physic? It is important not to confuse the cause with the effect, but apparently it is happening almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Education: People tend to confuse hard work with smartness, although smartness tends to be more sought after than hard work. If you can't outsmart them, out work them. Not everyone is born with the same mental capacity to grasp concepts easily. Some people just need to hear it once, and that is all it takes for them to fully understand. Likewise, not everyone is able to commit and put it a lot of effort to understand something. Lets be real, we get a bit lazy sometimes. So we have to evaluate ourselves, how smart are we? How hardworking are we? It seems it's harder to improve your cognitive abilities to be "Smarter", therefore, if we are lacking in any areas, we can only put in hard work. Do not look at others in envy and say "Oh, he does not study yet his results are fantastic." Do not attempt to adopt his studying methods. Do attempt to replicate his schedule and life. All of his time management and choices were made to be suited for him, and not for you. Just as a swimmers body was made for swimming, and not the converse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitness: How we train affects how we look. The more we train and the harder we train, the better the results. But how our bodies are in turn affects how we must train. A skinny body should cut down on cardiovascular activities, and focus more on gaining mass. A bulky body should not be focusing on lifting heavy weights, but engage in cardiovascular exercises. There is no one-size-fit-all training regime, because all our sizes are different, and its impossible to see the the same results from each different body given the same training regime. Instead of studying how others train, seek to understand your own body first. Your structural imbalances ( hip anterior/posterior tilts), your weaknesses (legs, arms), your own body size (endo, meso, ecto), your lifestyle (working adult, sedentary, very active). The list is not exhaustive, and there are countless of other factors that will affect your gains. Only once your have understood your body, you have then obtained the question, and the next step is to seek the answer. Do not look at bodybuilders and follow their regime. Their job is to build their body for competitions, thus their lifestyle is intrinsically different from yours, unless of course you are a bodybuilder yourself. Seek for more attainable goals and answers. Find a training regime to suit your lifestyle. Some bodies and lives were made for a good physic, and not the other way around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For now I have only gave these two examples, for they dominate most of my life at the moment (I'm a student who workouts often). But just give it a thought and you will see how the Swimmers body illusion really affects many areas in life. Just to throw out a few more: Work, Character, Affluence, Family relations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the bottom line of this is that, we should stop following people. Their lives and circumstances are entirely different from ours. We have our own lives that we have to find out for ourselves how the puzzles fits. There is no singular perfect answer for all our problems. Just because they succeeded, does not mean you will.

Below is the email conversation between me and professor regard the realism and non-realism view on religion. Realism views that a person who subscribes to religion attributes his faith solely in a divine being, while non-realism attributes it to human experiences and human feelings that they would search for a religion. I for one hold the non-realism view on religion. I thought it was interesting so I'm sharing it.



&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;

 



&lt;div dir="ltr"&gt;

*Good day Professor Andres,*
&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*It was an interesting discussion we had today in the Faith and Reason seminar, although slightly more dense and harder to grasp then the previous seminar.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*I would like to extend the discussion on realism and non-realism school of thoughts as it strikes deeply with me and is the possible reason why I am in this course.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*I hold the non-realism view on religion and would attribute all religious persuasions to purely human experience, and that also religion is a product of human conciousness. *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*I draw reference to Daniel C. Dennett's essay "An Evolutionary Account of Religion", in which he states in the section "The Roots of Religion" last paragraph, that "At the root of human belief in gods lies an instinct on hair trigger: the disposition to attribute agency - beliefs and desires and other mental states - to anything complicated that moves ...". Here, I would think that the subject matter would be anything complicated, and that would encompass human consciousness, human anatomy, works of nature etc. Thus, it is because we as humans with our limited knowledge cannot comprehend the entire mechanics of the cosmos, and it being complicated, we therefore attribute some form of agency to it, which is God.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*In an argument made by Leonard Mlodinow in the book "Is God an Illusion?", it is argued that when Reductionist reaches a certain point in which they can no longer find any plausible explanations, religion takes the opportunity to step in. An example would be the breaking down of the atom to protons, to quarks, to gluons and finally to strings. When science is unable to explain what happens at the string level (aside from the unproven string theory), religion is then quick to fill in the shoes and explain this phenomenon through supernatural means.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*I thus propose that it is human experiences, be it the dissatisfaction in the inability to explain a complex system through logical means, or the feeling of fear of death and uncertainty, that would lead us to seek answers that science cannot explain, and religion insofar provides some of the "best" explanations. Religion is able to quell these uncertainties and fears by providing religious explanations, and since science cannot disprove it, it is mostly accepted. In fact, as an atheist who subscribes to Humanistic Naturalism, we too have a set of beliefs to quell these fears and uncertainties, just that in doing so, we employ a non-supernatural approach (drawing instead from human values, knowledge and morality). Thus being a Naturalist is no different as being a Christian, even if they both provide radically different teachings, as both provides a common sense of comfort and suppresses the fear and uncertainty that science and reason cannot explain. It is at essence human experiences that drives us to seek answers, and this leads us to accept different teachings.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Also, in the class we had this problem with the non-realist view, as a person (Agnes, in our class) was willing to give up her religion if and only if Christianity was proven to be undoubtedly wrong. However, I would argue that since Christianity is simply an outlet for quelling human fears/uncertainties (something which I find possible with Naturalism as well), if she were to give up Christianity, she would then find another school of teaching that has not yet been proven false to answer her questions and doubts. Since at its rudimentary level it is driven by human experiences, religion is only one of the possible cures for our existential ailments. Non-religious approaches can also be employed to tackle this problem, as evident from the growing number of atheist in the world (Third biggest "religion" just behind Christianity and Islam &lt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2250096/You-wouldnt-believe-atheism-worlds-biggest-faith-Christianity-Islam.html&gt;).*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Finally, we also had one problem on non-realism that the believe in God extends beyond human experiences. I would argue that once a person is satisfied with an answer religion provides in one area, they subscribe to it entirely (and not cherry-pick). I would then refer to the essay "Thinking About God" in the section "What is Philosophy on Religion?" where it mentions implications, and that "... if a person believes x, what other beliefs must she logically accept, whether she realizes it or not?". Thus for the case of Agnes, if she believes and accepts the answers that Christianity provides for her mortal dilemmas (x), she must then implicitly accept that God exists in order to provide the answers (y), and further accept God's historical account that stretches beyond the manifestation of human conciousness back to before the Big Bang(z). Thus through the concepts of implications we can solve this issue.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*In simple conclusion, I believe in the non-realist view on religion, and that all religious devotions and convictions can be traced back to a fundamental human experience fuelling it. Fear would be the most common human feeling which would persuade one to subscribe to religion.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Apologies for the long letter and I appreciate your time spent in reading and trying to make sense of my argument (if any). I would wholeheartedly accept any counter arguments you provide and study them with due diligence.*



&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

*Dear Jin Hao, *
&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*These are very thoughtful comments. I love it! *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*I would encourage you to review the distinction between religious realism and religious nonrealism. The difference between the two views is not that religious nonrealism says religious beliefs are "products of human consciousness," while realism denies this. The two views conflict over the question of what religious beliefs are about. Religious realists think that religious beliefs are, in part, about an independently existing supernatural reality. Religious nonrealists deny this, and insist that religious beliefs are only about human experience.*



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Agnes said that she would abandon her faith if it were proven that there is no supernatural being called 'God' who pre-existed humankind, who created the universe, and who is all-knowing, all-powerful, and perfectly good. She said that she would abandon her faith, because she sincerely believes that this supernatural being exists, and if it turned out that God didn't exist, she would have no reason to continue believing in God. This suggests that Agnes's belief in God is really about an independently existing supernatural being, and not just about her experience. If Agnes's belief were really just about her own human experience, then her reason for having that belief wouldn't be extinguished by the discovery that God doesn't exist; instead her reason for believing in God would remain intact, provided that the belief continued to relate to her experience in the right way. *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*You may be right that if Agnes did one day abandon her belief in God, she would adopt a different set of beliefs to relieve her "existential ailments." But that doesn't show that her belief in God wasn't about a supernatural entity: the belief could serve the function of alleviating her existential ailments, while at the same time being about a supernatural entity. This is entirely compatible with religious realism. *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Like you, I think some hypothesis similar to Dennett's explanation of why people have religious beliefs is probably correct. This explanation is compatible with religious realism. I think religious nonrealism confuses the causes of a belief and the content of that belief. Experiences of dependence and vulnerability may cause a person to believe in God. But the content of that belief is something else--the content of the belief in God is WHAT is believed. And as Agnes freely told us, WHAT she believes is that there exists a supernatural entity called 'God.' The difference between the cause of a belief and its content is brilliantly explained by Roger Trigg in his "Defense of Religious Realism." *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Incidentally, the survey you mentioned doesn't say that atheism is the third largest "faith." Rather, the category is people who have no religious affiliation. They may include atheists, agnostics, people who have no opinion on spiritual matters, and people who have spiritual beliefs (like a belief in God) but don't identify themselves as members of any established religion. *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*On another topic, I disagree that human values, knowledge, and morality cannot be explained by reason and science. I think science is part of our knowledge, and a product of our capacity for reason. Knowledge of values and morality can also be attained through reason. *



&lt;div&gt;

* *



&lt;div&gt;

*Moreover, I even think questions of morality can be answered through scientific analysis. If you wish to watch it, here is a nice TED talk by Sam Harris that defends a view very similar to mine: &lt;http://www.ted.com/talks/sam_harris_science_can_show_what_s_right.html&gt; *



&lt;div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;

*Thanks for your note, I enjoyed reading it very much.*

I've always been asking questions about the meaning of life and what happens after death, and apparently religion is the ONLY outlet that (attempts) to answer these variants of question.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've been a Buddhist for quite some time, say around 18-20 years, but that was only by label. I did not really have any true conviction for Buddhism. And the reason I was a Buddhist was not because I found it interesting and picked it up, but rather it was forced upon me by my mother (Of which to this day I am furious about). I did learn a fair bit about Buddhism during those years. Concepts of Karma, reincarnation, the afterlife etc. But I guess you could attribute my sudden severance with the religion with a sudden onset of critical thinking. At some point in my life I think I "matured" mentally, and started realizing that life isn't all fun and games. There are real problems which will come my way sooner or later, and there are answers which I must actively seek and evaluate for myself. The road isn't paved for me, I must toil and create it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That questioning period was probably when I started to doubt Buddhism and it's teachings. It contained many mythological aspects to it that are present in other religions which would warrant me to be an unbeliever. I saw no distinct differences between Buddhism and other religions, which troubled me deeply. How can I proclaim my religion is true which dismissing the other religions, when at the heart of it all there is nothing I can put on the table to boost my credibility. And if I can't proclaim it to be true, I will not dedicate my life to something false. I must, however, give my respects to the teachings it has taught me. The Five Precepts; No killing, No stealing, No lying, No abuse of drugs, No sexual misconduct. And also the art of meditation, which has brought about tremendous benefits to me. But aside from that, I am an atheist.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was when I started reading books such as "Is God An Illusion" by Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow, discussing and debating about various real world issues. From there I learnt that religion still plays a very important role in today's society, and has its roots set deep into many minds of the masses, as much as I would like to ignore it from the stance of an atheist. I then went on to register for a module in my course named "Faith and Reason". It really should be named Religion and Logic based on the syllabus and the argumentative environment the course has adopted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So while chatting with my friend Matthias, who happens to be a very staunch Christian, I show and complained to him about the absurd amount of money I forked out to buy the textbook for the module. I also showed him the other book "Is God An Illusion" to him, to which he invited me to his church. I responded politely with a 5 second video of me shaking my head (Snapchatting). After which he messaged me: "At least experience both sides of the argument.". That sentence really struck me deep, as I realized how selfish and at the same time elitist about my atheistic persuasion I was. I had to give them a chance. They had as much a conviction to God as I had to the absence of it/him/her. And so I made arrangements with him and I was due to arrive at the church on Sunday, 19/1/2014.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was supposed to meet him 10am at Potong Pasir, and when the day came, I woke up late. I had half the mind to tell him that "I would not be able to make it", but then my inner soul made me add "in time" to the end of the excuse.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Atheist"></category><category term="Christianity"></category><category term="Chruch"></category></entry></feed>
