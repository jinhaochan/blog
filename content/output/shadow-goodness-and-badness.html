</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>The Shadow, a concept taken from a book I read, is a hidden part of our subconciousness. It works from the shadows, influencing our actions, our thoughts and our speech. All these happens, unknowing to us, while we are still left thinking we have full control of everything about us.</p>
<p>These Shadows, which as I will explain later, does not necessarily mean it is evil, as the name "Shadow" seems to suggest. Rather, it is like how shadow is formed by the abscence of light, the Shadow consciousness lurks in the abscence of awareness.</p>
<p>They are formed by experiences and memories of previous situations we encountered. These reflexes that we learned and adaptations that we took form over time train our subconcious to apply them when faced with a similar situation in the future. Our future is therefore binded tightly to our past.</p>
<p>So where does the distinction between the Good Shadow and the Bad Shadow come from?</p>
<p>To begin right from the start, we are all born with inherent goodness. No one taught us to love, yet we know how to. No training was done to teach us how to seek and give love. No conditioning was done to make it feel right to do good unto others. We are born with goodness, but we are unaware of it. The inherent Shadow Goodness.</p>
<p>Where does the Shadow Badness come from? Notice I did not use the word "inherent" to describe this bad Shadow. It is not inherent, it is a function of the attentiveness and nourishment towards the Shadow Goodness. The lesser goodness we experience, the more room the Shadow badness occupies.</p>
<p>When we were neglected as children, the goodness of recieving love is neglected, and this trains and conditions the soul to reject love, as if it was a norm. We adapt to the lack of love and guard ourselves against it. We learn the reflexes of not recieving love, and we allow the Shadow of badness to seep in.</p>
<p>As evil exists in the abscence of good, shadow in the abscence of light, cold in the abscence heat, the Shadow of Badness grows in the abscence of the Shadow of Goodness.</p>
<p>The way to reconcile with, and to heal the hurtful bad Shadow, is thus then to reinforce the good Shadow, the good unconscious. To nourish what is inherent in us, to feed the soul we were born with. Through mindful good thoughts, actions and speech in the conscious space, the subconscious learns these reflexes and adaptations to love.Â </p>
<p>It becomes accustom to give and recieve love, as we were born with the ability to do so right from the start.</p>
