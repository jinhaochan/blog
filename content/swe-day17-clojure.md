Today we're gonna be doing the given exercises of this Chapter. You can find the exercises [here](https://www.braveclojure.com/do-things/#Exercises). For each of these exercises, i'm going to be doing them on the `lein repl`

We'll be tackling the last 2 questions, which are ostensibly harder, plus, refactoring our hobbit code we saw in [day 15](https://www.osfork.com/clojure-example-program.html#clojure-example-program)
