    <p>Ive always had trouble spelling that word, but after going through it last Sunday (10th April), i've been searching up and reading about it so much, especially the recovery period.</p>
<p>I'm writing this posts now, because i've been inspired by all other posts by people who have gone through hemorrhoidectomy, and the tips they provide. I feel like i'm passing the flame down. Also, for people suffering hemorrhoids in silence, please do not feel shy about it, and consult a doctor if it starts bleeding.</p>
<p>[<strong>Background</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>I've been suffering from hemorrhoids for quite awhile now, probably about close to a year. It was one small tiny hemorrhoid that prolapsed whenever i took a dump, but it never really bothered me at all. Every time i wiped my butt, there was blood, but i took it as nothing, and simply pushed the piles back in.</p>
<p>Until one day, it started to bleed really badly. Blood was dripping non-stop, and the entire toilet bowl was filled with blood. When i stood up, blood was dripping my butt. Obviously this prompted me to go to a hospital (Parkway East) to visit a doctor (Dr Imran Nawaz) immediately, and a surgery was schedule the following day.</p>
<p>[<strong>Day before surgery</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Doctor told me not to consume any food, and only to drink clear liquid. I was set to do a colonoscopy, and a <strong><em>HEMORRHOIDECTOMY.</em></strong> Those words still scare me. I was given a bottle of "Fleet" to drink, which was oral sodium phosphate. Basically, it drains water from your body, and flushes the colon out clean.</p>
<p>Worst. Night. Ever.</p>
<p>Every 20 mins, i was rushing to the toilet to let out jets of water out from my butt. I could hardly catch any sleep, even up till 4am. At 5:30am, a nurse came in to give me another half dosage. My surgery was scheduled to be at 9:00am.</p>
<p>[<strong>Day of surgery</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>I was pretty calm about it. Joking and jesting with the nurses who brought me in to the surgery room (Su, Joseph and Al). It all happened to fast. I was given anesthesia, and fell straight to sleep, and the operation was performed</p>
<p><strong>[After surgery]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</strong></p>
<p>I woke up at about 1030am, and was still a little drowsy from the drugs. I was repeating whatever i heard from the nurses, and mimicking them. I was also telling jokes to the nurses, probably disturbing them working. Kinda embarrassing come to think of it!</p>
<p>I was to stay in the hospital for one more night for the nurses and doctor to check my wound, in case there was any sudden bleeding, or if i felt unwell. I was promptly discharged the next day.</p>
<p>[<strong>Day 1 -5 Post surgery</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>I can say i've never ever felt so much pain and discomfort in my life. I never knew this sort of pain was possible to a human. (Okay a little exaggerated.) Every time i had to poop, i was sweating, and my toes were clenched. I would be gritting my teeth and grabbing the walls because of the immense pain. Horrible horrible experience.</p>
<p>After every poop i had to take a warm bath to calm myself down, and i also had to take a sitz bath, which really helped a lot with the swelling.</p>
<p>I was constipated once, and it was so bad. Note to readers: Do not get constipated. Ever.</p>
<p><strong>[Moving on]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</strong></p>
<p>Its day 8 now as of writing this post. The pain has subsided immensely, and i can finally see the light of getting healed. Im starting to do light workouts such as squats and pull ups. I can finally sit up to get out of bed, instead of tumbling and rolling over. I can finally poop without feeling im going to faint from the pain.</p>
<p>My follow up appointment is on next Monday, and i'm really eager to see how much i've healed by then!</p>
