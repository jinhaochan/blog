Overall, it paints an optimistic view about the world, and points to several concrete evidences that the world is indeed getting better, and progressing towards a positive direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If anything, I would blame the media for sensationalizing the bad news, but that's their job. Our role, as responsible consumers, is to discern, based on our own critical thinking, what is truly being represented. We need to understand that, in order for the media to capture our attention, certain degrees of sensationaliztion is required, if not, media would extremely boring (clickbaits).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without further ado, here are the 10 acts of factfulness we must exercise when presented with infomation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Gap Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given information that depicts a gap (Most often, The Rich and the Poor), we must understand that the distribution of people lies in a normal curve, with a huge majority of people residing in the middle of it. That is, the middle class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hence, when presented with such forms of information, always look for the people within. That where the majority is, and it's not as polarizing as it seems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of the comparison of averages, and extremeties. Averages masks the outliers, Extremeties masks the majority.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be aware of your vantage point, and what you're comparing to. Where are you looking at the data from? Looking from a vantage point of extreme wealth, everyone else is poor to you. Understand how your views may be influenced by where you are in the world&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. The Negativity Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bad news reaches to you the fastest (through media). Good news would almost never reach you. You don't hear about the 8 thousand planes in the air everyday that do not crash, but you hear about the single plane that crashed over and over again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's not all propaganda to spread fear, but rather, a viable buisness model to create sensational headlines to attract attention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Things can be bad, and things can get better, but still be bad. Just because a situation has been bad for a long time, does not mean its not getting better. Look for gradual progress of "betters", even though the situation is still bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. The Straight Line Insticnt&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you look a graph, don't assume a straight line. Plateaus will be hit, and dips can happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other than Straight lines, other graph shapes include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;S shaped&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A Slide down &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Normal Curves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exponential Curves&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A child from ages 5-10 have a straight line growth in height, but that doesnt mean the line will extend straight all the way. It'll plateau and form an S shaped curve&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. The Fear Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Media always shows you the worse to play on your fears.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 categories of harm that we are afraid of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Physical Harm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Captivity; Loss of control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Contamination; Poisoning, virus, and unknown substances&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can classify sensational media to any of these categories&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. The Size Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When given a number, always have it in comparison with something else. Rate of... Compared to...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Numbers alone do not tell as much as comparisions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;80/20 rule usually applies, where 80% of effort contributes to 20% of the output, and 20% of effort contributes to 80% of the output. Look for the smaller unseen contributing factors. Usually, they are the cause of the 80% of the outcome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. The Generalization Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rarely are categories entirely distinct. When given categories, look for similarities between them, and look for differences within them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quite often, you can see that different categories are similar to each other, while within categories, there are some differences as well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When someone says "The Majority", do they mean 51%, or 99%? Becareful when hearing such general statements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't assume people are idiots. If a solution looks dumb to you, the other person might have a perfectly valid reason that we are unaware of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;7. The Destiny Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because some has been for a long time, does not mean it will be forever. There is no destiny set for anyone, or anything.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look out for gradual improvements. Even if the situation is still bad, there can still be positive progress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand the context of culture. What happened in the past might be due to a different culture from today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;8. The Single Perspective Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't use the same approach, and learned expertise on all situations. Just because you are an expert in one field, does not mean you are an expert in related fields.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at problems from another perspective, and angles that lie outside of your expertise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Why Don't You Just..." do something? Because you can't, and things are usually not as simple as they seem to prescribe simple solutions that you can "just do".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly test your long held ideas about how you usually approach problems. Fine tune it by getting it critqued by other experts and non-experts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;9. The Blame Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for Causes, not villians.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look for Systems, not heroes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recognize a Scapegoat when you see one, and resist falling into the trap of identifying a scapegoat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;10. The Urgency Instinct&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, you don't need it NOW, like how the media portrays it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To control the sense of urgency, take small steps, and insist on data to prevent rash, unsubstantiated actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beware of fortune tellers, and always ask for supporting evidence. Don't be afraid to call someone out for not telling the truth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's rarely a now or never situation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;End Remarks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I really liked the Blame instinct, Urgency instinct and Generalization instinct the most.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems like in today's society, where its moving way faster than we want, and we're loaded with so much information, we're more likely to commit those fallicies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whenever you see an ad on your social media, that is always accompanied by a count down. "Buy Now! Or Miss This Great Deal Forever!"... and you see the same deal 3 months later. They're playing on your urgency instinct, and no, you don't need another gadget in your life.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Blame instinct teaches us that outcomes are usually the cause of systems, and not people. Be it success or failure, the cause it almost always due to the circumstances/luck/network he exists in. Don't attribute so much of the outcome to the person, but the more to the things around him.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the sweeping statements that are still prevalent. Aside from this particular sentence, ALL claims don't usually apply to ALL circumstances. Never use the word "all", and always question when you see the word "all".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category></entry><entry><title>Barking Up The Wrong Tree</title><link href="/barking-up-the-wrong-tree.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-12-15T22:11:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-12-15T22:11:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chan Jin Hao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-12-15:/barking-up-the-wrong-tree.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;This was a short and simple book packed with succient life lessons, and exposes common fallacies we tend to view the world.

Specifically, it deals with the notion of success, and what makes a person successful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book tells of 6 things we think successful people do that makes them successful, and that if we do enough of it, we too, can be successful. And for each of these perceived actions, he provides a recommendedapproach, which in most cases ends up taking the middle path of non-extremeties.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In each of the 6 lessons, i'm going to cut through the fluff, and get straight to the point, and not tell stories and parables. Afterall, this is a summary, not an actual book itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. Play It Safe, or Do What We're Told?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filtered people don't rock the boat. Unfiltered people break the boat. Often people think they want a filtered leader, when what they actually NEED is an unfiltered leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you are a filtered person, go to company with rules, where complying with them means success (public sector). If you are an unfiltered person, go to a company that moves fast and break things, or create your own path.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What really matters here is picking the right pond, and knowing when to transit to the next pond once you're a big enough fish. Starting in a pond with too many big fishes will overshadow you. Starting in a pond where you're already the biggest fish gives you no growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a matching moral context matters more than you think. Does what the company do align with what you believe is right? e.g. working in cybersecurity allows me to defend companies from threats, and I believe that no one should be going around stealing data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"What are you good at that consistently produces desireable results?"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. Do Nice Guys Finish Last?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This section pulls some ideas from Adam Grant's book, Originals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Givers, Takers, Matchers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Givers give unconditionally. Matchers wait until they recieve something, before giving. Top and Bottom of the success list are Givers, while Matchers are in the middle. Bottom Givers give TOO MUCH. Top Givers give enough to win favors from people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Takers are no where on the list, because they are viewed negatively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't be a Taker or a Matcher. Be a prudent Giver.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being an asshole might help you in the short term (Taker), but over the long term, being a nice guy wins (Giver), just not too much of a nice guy (Over Giver).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, visbility matters. Make sure you work hard, and people are noticing you working hard. Sound out initiatives that you helmed, , and show people the progess you have helped make. Don't be too humble and quiet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Forgive people and their mistakes. Don't hold grudges.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. Do Quitters Never Win, and Winners Never Quit?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what you need to push through, and making time for it. Time is limited, you cannot be good at everything. Quit things that are iffy, and don't produce desirable results. Focus entirely on one or two things that you are absolutely sure will bring you far.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a wide breadth of knowledge is beneficial, but you MUST have at least one deep vertical. Don't be a afraid to try many things and quit, those things will add up to your breadth of knowledge. Make little bets on things you don't know about, and see where it takes you. Approach them with a mindset that 90% of the time it will fail, but it's all about learning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pessimism is usually an accurate gut feeling, but we need to have Flexible optimism. For high payoff stuff like your career and family, be overly optimistic about it. For low payoff stuff, be pessimistic, which often ends up being the truth. Being overly optimistic about everything makes you delusional. Being overly negatively makes you depressed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have a meaningful story behind your endeavours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gamify your obstacles. Your game must be Winnable, Novel, have Goals, and provide Feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get rid of things that are wasting your time. Again, you can't be good at everything, and be pessimistic about those activities. (I know I can be a good guitarist if I spend enough time on it. But what are the pay offs? Do I enjoy it? If not, put that thought about playing on stage aside and focus on something else.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;4. It's Not What You Know, but Who You Know&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Know who you are. Introvert, Extrovert, Ambivert. Pick the right pond that allows your character to flourish.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stop Networking, and start making Friends. Networking to keep people close for favours will never work when the time comes, but friends will genuinely help you out when needed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seek a mentor, and ask help from a bigger fish. You need to study someone and idolize them to grow towards something (Having a goal). At the same time, help the smaller fishes around you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are who you hang out with. No, really. Evaluate the people around you HARD, and know that you will become what they are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. Levels of Confidence&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you a very confident person? Keep that in check to make sure you're not delusional, and remember to stay empathetic. Seek situations that challenges and humbles you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you not a very confident person? Don't worry, you're most likely going to learn more because of your lack of confidence in your abilities. However, don't doubt yourself too much, because you need to be visible and seen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Success--&amp;gt;Confidence, not the other way around. Same with Action--&amp;gt;Inspiration. Work hard at what you do until you become successful, and that will inspire confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fake it till you make it... just don't fake yourself. Don't be something you're not, instead, show your best self everyday and not your lazy self. Eventually, you'll fake people into thinking you're always the best (even though you're lazy at times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have more self-compassion. Don't be so harsh on yourself when you make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;6. Hardwork&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Track your time, and split up work accordingly. Stop multitasking, start monotasking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time is limited, focus your efforts selectively on one thing. It does not matter if you only accomplished one thing in a day, as long as it was purposefully done with effort. That is better than half-assing 5 things.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont measure yourself based on one thing, it does not make sense. Instead, use multiple yard sticks for measurement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happiness = Feeling contented
Achievement = Winning at something
Significance = Impacting others
Legacy = Establishing something that enables others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Talk to your boss about expectations of your work. This is not just for you and clarity of your work, but for your boss as well, so he knows how to fairly judge you when the time comes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Throw away your to do list, and start actually planning and scheduling them. Cement that time slot for something and actually do it, instead of putting them on the back burner of To-Do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to say No to things that waste your time, or distract you. Yes, this means saying to no to a co-worker who calls for one too many teabreaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take control of your environment. Declutter your desk. If the open office is too noisy, don't be afraid to book a quiet room just for work. You will cut off distractions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;End your day on time, and in the right way. Plan for the next day.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category></entry><entry><title>Perfectionism</title><link href="/perfectionism.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-11-09T13:11:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-11-09T13:11:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chan Jin Hao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-11-09:/perfectionism.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;After reading the book "Overcoming Pefectionism", I don't think I have servere perfectionism, but I have some symptoms of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of background on why I picked this book up in the first place. I found myself being very critical towards myself when I didn't meet my expectations. Be it in work, or in leisure, or sport. I was a harsh critic when I did not score enough points in basketball. I was harsh on others, when they did not perform to how I expected them to (Although, I was harsh internally, and did not criticize them openly). I had this all or nothing thinking sometimes, and I kept raising the bar to the point where it would be almost impossible for me to be satisfied.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;7/10 Free throws? Why not 8/10? You learnt React and Redux? Why not GraphQL, or whatever latest technology there is? I kept looking at what could be achieved, but rarely what I have achieved. I was aware of this negative trait, and so to explore it further, I picked up this book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Unhelpful VS Helpful Perfectionism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is an obvious distinct between these two mental models. "Curing" Perfectionism does not mean lowering your standards. It means stopping the unhealthy mental habits you have when you don't meet your standards. Or as how the book states it: &lt;code&gt;Perfectionism is defined as trying to achieve demanding standards you have set for yourself, despite negative effects, and basing your self worth on how well you think you achieved your standards.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite Negative Effects. This can be both physical (Practicing too much basketball), or Mental (Constantly berating yourself as a failure). When you push through these negative effects for the sake of acheiving demanding standards, you have perfectionism. I do this, but not at an extreme level. I'm aware enough to identify that these are unhealthy habits, and now, putting a finger on it, it helps a lot to really address the issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Problem Brought About By Perfectionism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Avoidance&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid doing a task, or a situation because you are afraid of failing. I don't do this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Procrastination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar to avoidance, but putting of doing a task for fear of failure. I don't do this either.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Performace Checking&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I'm most guilty of out of the 3. Constantly checking to see how i'm doing by comparing with my peers. If my peer can learn all these technologies and build a beautiful repsonsive web application, why can't I? If my peer can hit 9/10 3 pointers, why can't I?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are 3 sub categories of Performance Checking:
1. Constant Retesting to make sure you really are worthy, and it was not by luck.
2. Comparing with others to see how I've done
3. Seek reassurance from others on my performance&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'm most guilty of performance checking, and seeking reassurance from others. Am I doing my job well enough? Is my boss praising me for my work? If he doesn't does it mean I'm doing a bad job? (Of course not!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Constantly restesting my skill happens in basketball. I hit 7/10 free throw. Bah! I was lucky. Let me shoot another 20 just to make sure I got it. (Repeat n number of times)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being aware of these now, I have to address them. If no one reassures my work done, it's fine. It's not their job to do so. If I hit a certain standard, stop retesting yourself, and placing doubt on your ability.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Fictions of Perfectionism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The harder you work, the better you'll perform&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;FALSE. If you overwork yourself, in sports or at work, you'll be burnt out, and perform a lot worse than how you planned to in the first place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To get ahead, you have to be single minded, and exclude all other interest&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;False again. By engaging in other activities that are entirely unrelated to your work, you're exploring and activating parts of your brain you don't usually use at work. This is how creativity arises. By transferring knowledge cross activities. Patience from drawing, Endurance from sports, Persistance from basketball, Focus from reading. These are attributes have no fixed categories, and can be applied everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;People notice every single detail, and can be critical&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;People notice details. People don't notice EVERY single detail. No one thinks about you as much as you think they do. Everyone is busy thinking about what others think about them, including you. So relax! And don't be concerned at all about what others think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;All or Nothing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The most dangerous thinking of them all. If I can't do it perfectly, then I won't do it at all. Thankfully, I don't have this thinking, and I would accept flaws in my work. In fact, my motto leans more towards "Just Do It", even if it's done badly. &lt;code&gt;There's no such thing as a bad run. Every run improves you even by a bit.&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Learn to notice the positives&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't discount praises and achieves, and only focus on the negatives. Where did you do well? What did other say about you that was positive? "You defend well, but you improve on your shooting." Instead of telling yourself that you're bad because you have poor shooting, also take note how well you're defending.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That's not to say that you "Always look on the bright side of life", and ignore the negatives. Acknowledge the negatives and work on them. But also take awhile to pat yourself on the back for the things well done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although there was alot of principles stated in the book, I only extracted out those that stood out to me. I think the bottom line of it all is to Learn to Love Yourself More. Really think about that sentence and what it entails.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Love yourself. Mentally, Physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be compassionate to yourself. Mentally, Physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be forgiving to yourself. Mentally, Physically.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about how you would treat your loved one and friends. You don't be overly critical at them for fear of damaging your relationships. Likewise, don't be overly critcal at yourself. You would give advice, forgive and support them. Likewise, give advice, forgive and support yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category></entry><entry><title>Strengths Finder; And mine</title><link href="/strengths-finder.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-09-29T15:53:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-09-29T15:53:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chan Jin Hao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-09-29:/strengths-finder.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;First off, before I begin, I just want to say that I picked this book up for a steal of $5, where the original cost was somewhere around $30.

I think I might visit book fairs more often, but the downside being that they don't usually carry very good quality books, both in terms of content and physical outlook. This book was just a gem amongst a whole lot of crappy (sorry!) books.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moving on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The 34 Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book listed 34 different kinds of strengths, and i'm not going to list them all out as you can easily find them out with a search on the internet. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There 4 themes that the 34 types of strengths can be compartmentalized into:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Executing Theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Influencing Theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relationship Building Theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strategic Thinking Theme&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These 4 themes, when taken into the context of work, all "Get things done", but they each influence how things get done.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Executing theme shows strengths of "Getting it done efficiently".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Influencing theme shows strengths of "Getting everyone to get it done".&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Relationship Building theme shows the strengths of "Getting it done amicably"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Strategic Thinking theme shows strengths of "Getting it done correctly"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Getting it done Efficiently and Getting it done Correctly might seem similar, but you can be doing something efficiently, but wrongly if the direction is not properly set. That's where Strategic Thinking comes into play to set the course of action in the right direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Strengths&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book "forced" us to choose top 5 strengths by putting a list for you to fill up on the cover page. I thought that was a good exercise, because people relate to many "Strengths", but some more strongy than others. By forcing you to pick 5, you really have to think it over, and identify what truly resonates with you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are all the Strengths I identified with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Activator (Influencing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Context (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Focus (Executing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Futuristic (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideation (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Input (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Intellection (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learner (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizer (Influencing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restorative (Executing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significance (Influencing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, before I did this exercise, I had no knowledge of the 4 different themes. Looking back retrospectively, we can see that I'm super dominant on Strategic Thinking (7/12). Influencing (3/12) and Executing (2/12) follows shortly. As we can see... I don't have any Relationship Building themes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just because I have no Relationship Building themes does not mean that i'm an asshole. It just means that it's not my strength to promote harmony and relationships, and I'm more of a "Let's get it done" person. More specifically, I'm a "Let's get it done correctly" person.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I find that this resonates with me, looking at how I feel and act in my work place. Again, it's not that I don't have friends, but building team cohesiveness is not my forte. Doing the work correctly and efficiently, and coming up with new ideas is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My Top 5&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the list above, I've then narrowed it down to the the 5 strengths that really resonate with me&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analytical (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ideation (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learner (Strategic)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Maximizer (Influencing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restorative (Executing)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process of me withering it down to the top 5 took me a while, because some I felt that I really identified with some strengths until I truly questioned them, and looked at my previous actions if they honestly reflected those attributes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to say, not putting strengths in my top 5 is not a binary I have it or I don't thing, it just means they are ranked lower, but I still have them in me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, I felt that I resonated with Context, because I whatever work we do, I would always ask: "Why are we doing this?", "Has other company done it before?", "Why did they succeed or fail?". But if I don't ask these questions, I don't feel uncomfortable, and I can still move on with the project. However, if I don't activate my Maximizer, and the job is done haphazardly, that really gets on my nerves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Where It Started&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This inquisitive journey started after I finished the book SPIKE, by Rene Carayol. SPIKE stands for Strengths Positively Identified, Kick-start Excellence), and it really changed my way of thinking about asking questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Instead of constantly focusing on the negatives, and "areas of improvement", we don't ask enough the question "What are you great at?". Instead of trying to fix all of the flaws of a person (which is impossible), we should find out how we can leverage on what you're already naturally good at.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strengths finder has narrowed down what i'm good at, and I should focus on them until I'm great at it.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category><category term="Readings"></category><category term="Strengths Finder"></category></entry><entry><title>Branches of Machine Learning</title><link href="/branches-of-machine-learning.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-06-02T15:30:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-06-02T15:30:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chan Jin Hao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-06-02:/branches-of-machine-learning.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Just finished reading the book "The Master Algorithm", where the author tries to find the ultimate Machine Learning algorithm that can solve different varieties of problems (text, image, predictive, time series etc)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;The Evoluntionaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Connectionist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Symbolist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Bayesians&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Analogizers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":323,"align":"center"} --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="placeholder" class="wp-image-323" src="/media/2019/02/master-algo_thumb.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lets look at what the 5 tribes have to offer, and their each individual "Master Algorithm"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Evolutionaries&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;Genetic Algorithm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss Function: &lt;strong&gt;Fitness Function&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization Function: &lt;strong&gt;Genetic Search&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tribe tries to represent learning by mimicking evolution, where the it uses survival-of-the-fittest idea to pick the best model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting with weak and not-fit models, the models go through different biologically inspired evolutionary stages: Mutation, Cross Over and Selection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Evolutionaries focus on learning the structure of the model, and not so much of the parameters (something which Connectionist with neural networks focus on)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Connectionists&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;Neural Networks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss Function: &lt;strong&gt;RMSE&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization Function: &lt;strong&gt;Gradient Descent and Back Propagation&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Connectionist represent learning by modelling it after the brain and the neuron connections inside them. Dendrites, Axons and the Cell made up the Neural Network.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Neural Networks, we are trying to learn the weights of the connections between the cells, and not the structure of the neural network itself (Perhaps there could be a combination of GA and NN, where GA finds the structure, and NN finds the weights)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It follows the notion that a concept can be represented by firing various neurons, and concepts that are similar to each other will cause the same set of neurons firing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Symbolist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;Logic&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss Function: &lt;strong&gt;Accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization Function: &lt;strong&gt;Inverse Deduction&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symbolist believe that all intelligence can be reduced to symbols, or rules. They build rule base systems, which obviously have huge limitations, because we can't possibly convert all intelligence and edge cases to a hard coded rule. The moment the rule encounters just a slightest bit of noise, it fails to perform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, real life scenarios and concepts are seldom defined in black and white rules, and are usually stochastic and in the grey area.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some cases, they can perform quite well. A model that Symbolist use are decision trees, which are huge tree that have if-else rules at each branch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Bayesians&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;Graphical Models&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss Function: &lt;strong&gt;Posterior Probability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization Function: &lt;strong&gt;Probabilistic Inference&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As opposed to frequentist, which gives no value to prior beliefs, Bayesians hold prior beliefs at the center of their model.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bayesian works on conditional probability, or Bayes Theorem, that tells the probability of event A happening given that B has occurs &lt;code&gt;P(A|B)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the training phase, the model takes the training data to build a list of conditional probabilities. During testing, given certain features, the model will use the conditional probabilities to perform predictions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Naive Bayes algorithm is one that assumes that all probabilities are independent of each other. Although it is not a valid assumption in the real world, it still performs quite well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;The Analogizers&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Master Algorithm: &lt;strong&gt;Support Vector Machines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Loss Function: &lt;strong&gt;Margin between Support Vectors&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Optimization Function: &lt;strong&gt;Constrained Optimization&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tribe uses similarities among various data points to categorize them to distinct classes. Based on the similarity between data points, we can relate them together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Models in this tribe are K-Nearest-Neighbor and Support Vector Machines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is a review of the book "The Power of Agency", and they offer 7 steps for you to regain this sense of control&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep a clear head and control the amount of stimuli you get&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Associate selectively with people&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Exercise and move&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always position yourself as a learner no matter where you are&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keep your emotions in check&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn how to read your intuition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Deliberate before acting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keeping a clear head&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Practice meditation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont multitask&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Filter your sources of information&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Reduce junk information (social media)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Put away your phone. Far far away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A traditional pen and paper brings more clarity as opposed to typing&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace boredom, and use it as a moment for self reflection&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Associate Selectively&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You have Mirror neurons. Mix around with positive people, and you will mirror them&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Other people have Mirror neurons. Act positively and others will follow suit&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont fall into the herd mentality, and disassociate yourself from negative emotions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to say No&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being unpopular is okay&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make or break unhealthy relationships&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Exercise and Move&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walk more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stand more&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to understand the signals your body is giving you (Hungry? Tired?)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Go and experience new places and cultures&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sleep a priority&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Always be Learning&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pursue new knowledge not within your domain&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Learn to embrace failure in learning&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Find out what kind if learner are you&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get feedback from others&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bounce and voice out your thought chains and get validation&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look from other peoples perspective&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Keep Your Emotions In Check&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Values are not Beliefs. Values are more general. Beliefs are more specific&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tear down misconstructed beliefs from the past. They may not be valid&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Identify emotions with names and words&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Look at the grander scheme of things&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Channel your emotions somewhere&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Intuition&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I personally didn't like this chapter, because I find the lessons quite gray and not very concrete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It seems to just say, trust your heart, which is, to me, one of the worse advice to give anyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deliberation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dont be seduced by shortcuts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Name your mental steps to your conclusion&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Question the decision you made&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay open to alternatives&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ask yourself 3 questions for each decision&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How did I arrive to that decision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What other alternatives are there&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How am I feeling during the decision making process&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This book seems to start off as a biography, but it's intent becomes clear by the second chapter, that it's about the changes Satya brings about in Microsoft, and the anticipation of the future innovations such as Mixed Reality, Artificial Intelligence, and Quantum Computing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll like to highlight the 2 important lessons I took away from this book&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:list {"ordered":true} --&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Culture being at the heart of everything&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaboration brings about greater benefits&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Trust that the consumers places in you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:image {"id":439} --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="placeholder" class="wp-image-439" src="/media/2019/05/picture1.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, this diagram was the biggest take away of the book.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I'll like to emphasize that Culture sit inside BOTH Capabilities and Concepts, meaning to say it affects both circles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We start off with Concepts, which are innovative ideas that we have and we want to implement. This is the result of Culture that support and promotes creative thinking. A Culture that allows and embraces new ideas, and is welcoming to change. A dead culture is one that is not open to change, and resistant to any new ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, we have Capabilities. To realize the ideas derived produced in Concepts, we need to have the right Capabilities. The right people, right infrastructure, right processes. If there isn't the right Capabilities , it can always be built by hiring the right people, setting up the needed infrastructure, and defining proper processes. All these Capability building cannot happen with the right Culture.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the heart of it all, Culture reigns supreme. There are many definitions of Culture, but my very own short and simple definition is&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:quote --&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Guiding Principles to Solutions&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;!-- /wp:quote --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When coming up with a solution to any problem, what are the principles that guide you?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you face an issue of sexual harassment at the work place, what principles do the company policies have to dealing with it: Two strikes, or one strike?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone writes spaghetti code, what principles do the engineers have to dealing with it: Teach, or reprimand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If engineers feel stagnant, what principles do the managers have: neglect, or constant training?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Culture is not related to just one issue, but to many issues within the company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Collaboration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Information age, it is no longer a Zero-Sum game, where information shared would not lead to a loss of information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nadella talks about the various collaborative efforts that Microsoft engaged in, many initially questionable, but paid off in the end. Some of them are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborating with their long standing rival Apple, to develop Microsoft Office applications for MacOS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Collaborating with Linux to integrate Linux environment into Windows, and to provide first class support to Linux machines in Azure Cloud&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Others such as Yahoo and Samsung&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Collaboration almost always leads to greater results, but I personally feel we should be wary of who we collaborate with. Collaborating with companies or people who have no value to you ends up being a dead weight. Selective Collaborate should be done, with clear objectives on both sides, and obvious rationales for collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As mentioned, it is no longer a Zero-Sum game, and we should not be afraid of intermingling of knowledge.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="Review"></category></entry><entry><title>Reinventing Capitalism in the Age of Big Data: Summary</title><link href="/reinventing-capitalism-in-the-age-of-big-data-summary.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2019-04-21T20:28:00+08:00</published><updated>2019-04-21T20:28:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Chan Jin Hao</name></author><id>tag:None,2019-04-21:/reinventing-capitalism-in-the-age-of-big-data-summary.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I've finished this book a few months ago, and realized it'll be useful for me to recap the points I've learnt from the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 1: Reinventing Capitalism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Difference between conventional markets and data-rich markets is the role of information flowing through them, and how the information gets translated into decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In data-rich markets, we no longer have to condense all our preferences to a single dollar sum value, which can be an oversimplification of our preference&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are short-comings in data rich markets, which are over reliance on the data, and lack of diversity of the data and algorithms. This could lead to a data-monopoly, where the company with the most data dominates the industry&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 2: Communicative Coordination&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Human successes so far is predicated mainly on our ability to communicate and coordinate with each other. Coordination relies on our ability to communicate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology, more specifically volume of information, is increasing our ability to communicate with each other, hence increasing our coordination tremendously.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets and firms help humans coordinate more efficiently through economies of scale, where managing the pay and decisions of several workers is easier than managing each individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the Market, decisions are decentralized, producing the "Invisible hand". In the firm, decisions are centralized, and top-down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 3: Markets and Money&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How the structure of the market is linked to information, and how the information flows and are translated to decisions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information, and the cost of transmitting them, is integral to the success of a Market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Markets are decentralized, and so is the flow of information. There is no single point of failure in the market.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cascades of bad information in the market will lead to a market crash (housing market bubble, stock market crashes)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A huge volume of information however, will cause our cognitive abilities to fail. Hence, we use money as a denomination to be a summary of our preferences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money encapsulates our preferences and priorities into a single unit of information: Price&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Priced-based markets have been dominating for many years, but it might not be the best to represent the market in the information age.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 4: Data-Rich Markets&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The solution is to replace or complement price with rich and comprehensive streams of data. Rather than relying solely on price as an information, we have other sources of data to provide information as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The difference between conventional Markets and Data-Rich Markets is the volume and variety of data flowing through it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Three technologies are required to reconfigure the market&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a standard language when comparing our preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Better match preferences along multiple dimensions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Devise effective way to comprehensively capture all our preferences&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Those 3 technologies translate rich data into effective transaction decisions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;One of the challenges of a Data-Rich Market is getting the labels correct for each data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transformation from a conventional Market to a Data-Rich Marker:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improvements in data ontology to extract data from multiple streams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Advances in preference matching algorithms&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine Learning to identify preferences from user activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 5: Companies and Control&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms aim to offer human coordination at a lower cost via economies of scale.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information flow in firms were transform from accounting for the past, to a strategic tool for future planning. Scientific Management is the term for collection and processing multiple sources of information in the firm for planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Information and decision making in firms are centralized at the top, with a few instances of delegation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 6: Firm Futures&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms persist when they operate more efficiently at organizing human effort.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A focus on improving efficiency relies on two factors:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are there inefficiencies to be eliminated?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is the time period to implement the improvements? (Over a longer time, the gains get marginally smaller)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Firms can either Automate decision making, or rearrange their internal organization, which indirectly changes their decision-making structure.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restructuring of the organization is a human construct, while automation of decisions removes the decision making process away from the manager to a machine learning system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Restructuring still leaves humans in place, while automating decisions completely removes the need for humans.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In future, firms may end up as one of the two forms&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A firm that owns most of the resources needed for operations and employs some humans, but is manged and run by machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A firm that relies on market mechanisms, but sheds away most of their organizational functions&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 7: Capital Decline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Data-Rich Markets, consumers no longer use price as an indicator of information. Money thus loses one of it's functions, though it won't lose it's usefulness entirely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As market participants look for and consider richer data, fewer of them will rely on money, and wont be willing to pay as much for it's informational function. This is detrimental to banks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Money thus cannot convey multiple sources of information to the consumer, and the consumers must rely on other means to obtain the information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As the economy shifts to being Data-Rich, most information flows will not come from the banks. Banks will still handle transactions, but it will not be the source of information as it used to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The demise of money as the primary conveyor of information means there will be a decline in the role of Capital as well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Capital conveys information. It signals that a company has assets for disposal that it can exchange for other factors of production.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As markets embrace information, the two functions of capital - information and value - will be separated. It will only hold value, but not information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As capital is abundant, and fewer companies are looking for capital, this means supply of capital outstrips demand, and thus the returns on investments for capital is falling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Banks thus try to cut cost, and reinvent themselves as information intermediaries&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 8: Feedback Effects&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are three distinct effects at play when markets become concentrated&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale Effect - Economies of scale&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Network Effect - Value of service increases when more people engage in it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback Effect - Systems gain feedback to learn&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Scale decreases cost, Network expands utility, and Feedback improves the product.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Volume of data greatly increases the Feedback effect, and companies that hold monopoly over data have an advantage over smaller companies with little and poor data.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Machine learning systems thus undermine competition, and data hoarding can be anti-competitive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open algorithms are not as helpful as open data to combat anti-competitive behavior.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Large companies wont lose anything when they share a small portion of their data. Their products will still improve, but you would help other smaller companies improve their products as well.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relying solely on one decision making machine learning model is also fatal, as it is a bottleneck for mistakes. There should thus also have competition for decision making systems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 9: Unbundling Work&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data-Rich Markets and data-driven machine learning systems are changing the way humans work. There is a decrease in the percentage of people participating in the labor force.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Automation will slowly replace humans in the workforce. There are two ways to respond to this shift:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Distributive: As income shifts from labor to capital, the automation income can be taxed. Example, taxing machine and computers running the machine learning models - Robotax&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Participatory: Retraining workers who have been made redundant.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Proposal of Universal Basic Income: Just enough money for basic necessities like food, shelter and education.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not all automation replaces work, but some can help relief work and make it easier. - labor augmenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Companies that hold dominance in the market, with strong feedback, and monopoly on data lead to significant market concentration: Google, Facebook, Amazon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We need to define elements of work, and make them flexible enough to be recombined. UBI provides flexibility in the human choice when choosing work, because some tension in income requirements is alleviated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;!-- wp:heading {"level":3} --&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Chapter 10: Human Choice&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key Ideas:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a world of automation and machine performing decision making, what would humans do?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Task of humans, is not to be efficient, like robots, but to be creative and adventurous and feel alive, unlike robots&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;By freeing our minds very several mundane and routine decisions, we can focus on things that really matter&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I've just finsihed reading &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Culture-Code-Secrets-Highly-Successful/dp/0525492461"&gt;The Culture Code&lt;/a&gt;, and it was a really good book. Good books are those that either introduces new ideas, or reintroduces known ideas to be relevant.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this book, he explores what are the cultural values that make up successful team. 3 cultural values were identified, and they are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Provide Psychological Safety&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Embrace Vulnerability&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Create Purpose&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Psychological Safety&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Psychological safety means that person feels safe. Not physically safe (physical safety is assumed to be present, by law), but mentally safe.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Safe to sound out ideas, safe to make mistakes, safe to question assumptions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By providing a safe environment for the employees to work in, they can perform at their best.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some actions to provide psychological safety are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcommunicate your listening&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the person know that his ideas are valued, and he is being listened to. Avoid interrupting the person when he is talking. Seek to understand, and not just listen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the messenger&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bringing bad news is tough, and you should appreciate the person who is willing to do it. Don't shoot the messenger, he is doing everyone a favour by telling the bad news. If he didn't care, he wouldn't even tell. By telling, it shows that he cares, so care for him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overdo Thank-Yous&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the person know how appreciative you are. Even if you are his leader, thank him for allowing you to coach him. When things are going right, thank the person. When things are going wrong, thank the person. Thank the least significant person. By thanking the person, we let him feel that he is valued.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eliminate bad apples&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The bad apples lead to the broken window theory. A single person with bad behaviour encourages others to follow suit. Eliminate the bad behaviour, or eliminate the person. No one is to be a dickhead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create Safe, Collison rich places&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A collison rich place is one that meetings can happen spontaneously. Serendipity is what they call it. Lunch corner that encourage people to hang out together instead of eating at their desk. Game corners that allow people to have fun together. Physical proximity plays a big part in cooperative behaviour.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone has a voice&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simple enough. Make sure everyone is able to voice out their opinions. No idea/opinion is a stupid idea/opinion. Whats worse than having bad ideas, is having no ideas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Avoid the sandwich feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea of the sandwich feedback is to lessen the impact of the negative feedback, but thats really full of shit. Separate your feedbacks into two portions, Good feedback, and then Bad feedback. That's it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Have fun together&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Duh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Embrace Vulnerability&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We're all not as smart as we think we are, and the sooner your team realizes that, the quicker they will grow. If everyone acknowledges they suck, everyone will want to learn. If the team constantly exudes the air of false confidence, no one will dare to exhibit fallibility, and that will cause a huge crack in team dynamics&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if you're a leader, make your vulnerabilities known (Not personal or character vulnerabilities, but professional ones). Admit to what you don't know, and your subordinates will respect you more, else they will (and they will), think that you're an arrogant ass.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone secretly feels vulnerable, and when you show yourself to be vulnerable, this gives an opportunity for them to relate to you. "Oh hey, you don't know what's going on too! Let's learn together!"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some actions to embrace vulnerability are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure the leader is the first to be vulnerable&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only when the leader shows that it's okay to be vulnerable, will his subordinates follow suit. If they leader projects the image that vulnerability is unacceptable, no one would show it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3 questions leaders should ask: What should I continue doing, what am I not doing enough, how can I enable you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overcommunicate Expectations&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Make sure everyone knows their roles well, and exactly what is expected of them. Only with defined roles can someone identify what their lacking to fulfill those roles and meet those expectations. If someone doesn't know where he's going, then he doesn't what he needs to improve on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback Feedback Feedback&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let the team know how well they are doing, how badly they are doing. Use methods such as AARs (After Action Reviews) to elicit feedback, and to give feedback. Sample questions are: What were the intended results, what were the actual results, what caused the results, what will we do same, what will we do different, what have we learnt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Feedback should be entirely professional, and never personal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the discomfort&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vulnerability is something personal, and bringing it out to public can be quiet uncomfortable, but entirely necessary. Only by letting everyone know, will there be an opportunity for feedback and growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Create Purpose&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create a story for the team to be part of. Create something that is greater than the self, and people would sacrifce themselves for it. If there is no greater purpose and only self interest, the team cannot function optimally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some actions to create purpose are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Be extremely clear about your priorities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are we about? Where are we headed? Everyone must know about this, and it shoulden't be enigmatic and unclear. An unclear story leads to unclear actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of proficiency, and the purpose of creativity&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Proficiency is needed for repeatable tasks, Creativity is needed for new tasks. Identify within the group which teams are for proficiency, which teams are for creativity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Embrace the use of catchphrases&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even if they sound cheesy, but the work. A company motto that is easy to remember and simple to understand builds an identiy that the teams can assume. "Talk Less, Do More", "Work Hard, Be Nice"&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Use artifacts&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To build a convincing story, you sometimes need physical artifacts to bring out the realism in it. The Navy Seals display the battle gears of KIA operators, Pixar displays their Oscars. Showcase something significant to the company that sets the backdrop for the story.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Focus on barsetting behaviours&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Writing clean code, using source control and other behaviours that are consider best practices. When the team focuses on those behaviours, it becomes part of the identity that the team can assume. "Our team does xxx behaviours!" It's like a culture of excellence that originates from being part of the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
