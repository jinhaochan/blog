</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Life is a peculiar thing, in which we can have different views about it, and they will all be perfectly valid. The view that it is all about suffering, the view that it is about maximizing pleasure or the view that it has no meaning at all. And these are all perfectly valid views because they come from a collective subjective experience. You can't say it is definitely wrong, because the person has a life as well, and with that, he has every right to see how it is.</p>
<p>But I would like to focus on two views on life</p>
<p>1) Top-down view: This view says we first believe in a higher abstracted meaning, and all subsequent actions are justified and adjusted to fulfil that meaning.</p>
<p>2) Bottom-up view: This view says we still have an abstracted belief, but how we attain it is guided through our actions. In this view, the belief can be modified and changed in order to justify actions.</p>
<p>In this case, it is best if we all took the Top-down view of things. A Bottom-up view allows you to morph and conjure lies to mask the belief in order to suit your liking. This gives a very dubious and unreliable compass to guide us.</p>
<p>A Top-down approach on the other hand gives us a staunch and firm ground for us to anchor of decisions and actions on. And all consequential outcomes can be drawn back to a common belief it was derived from, giving us an objective assessment of the belief we were holding. Therefore, if the outcomes were undesirable, either we stop the action, or rebase our beliefs. This is contrast to the moving goal-post of the Bottom-up approach</p>
