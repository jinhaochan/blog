</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So I've seen this book around for quite some time, but have been avoiding it because i'm quite saturated with self-help books. However, one day I decided to make an impulse purchase on this, and I've definitely not regretted it.</p>
<p>Below are some of the summary points he made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Not giving a f*ck does <strong>NOT</strong> mean indifference. It means that you have a goal you want to achieve, and you don't give a f*ck about what it takes to get it. (criticism, doubt, naysayers)</li>
<li>It's important to give a f*ck about something. This can be translated to: It's important to find a problem you want to solve (This is as opposed to: It's important to find something that makes you happy!) By finding a problem you are interested in and you want to solve, you are then willing to go through the suffering that entails solving the problem, and the following satisfaction (or the elusive happiness!). Problems -&gt; Solutions -&gt; Satisfaction</li>
<li>Embrace mediocrity. You are not the special 1% high achievers. You are the 99% that makes the rest of the world. Being normal and average is okay, that's why its called the average. If everyone was special, then special would be average, and the next tier would be exceptionally special (which, if every special person thought they would be, it would become average again). Don't stress about being <strong>THE </strong>best. STRIVE to be <strong>YOUR</strong> best. And even if your best is globally average, so what?</li>
<li>Take responsibility for everything that's happening to you, emphasis being on feelings. Don't offload the responsibility of feeling happy to someone else. If someone is an asshole to you, you are responsible to how you feel about it. If you hate your job and your bosses, you are responsible to do something about it. Once you take ownership of things in your life, you will have more control and direction over where it's headed. Stop victimizing yourself.</li>
<li>Questions your beliefs. You've had them for a long time, and it got you to where you are. The kicker is: [Did you get here <strong>BECAUSE</strong> of it, or did you get here <strong>IN SPITE</strong> of it?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}<strong> </strong>Tear down and evaluate your beliefs. An example: I used to belief that if people didn't make time for me, they didn't care about me. That's extremely selfish thinking, and obviously not true. They are just as busy as you are. Safe to say, that belief has been torn down. Don't be so sure about yourself.</li>
<li>If you feel like you're not motivated to do stuff, then this simple graph will help you: Actions -&gt; Inspiration -&gt; Motivation -&gt; Action. Simple, to get motivated, you have to start.</li>
<li>Following the action from point 6: When you do anything, commit yourself entire to doing it. Don't half ass your way through life. Do it well. Read in depth. Understand everything about that problem and domain (to the best of your ability). Aim high up to master it, and even if you fail, you would have landed pretty far anyway. <strong><em>"Aim For The Stars, If You Fail, You'll Land On The Moon."</em></strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Now i'll elaborate on a thought or an idea that came when reading this book, which is how to measure success.</p>
<p>Success should be measured by a metric that is entirely under <strong>YOUR </strong>control. It's something stems directly from your effort, not others.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a measurement using a metric not within your control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success means people like me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can't control how people feel, so success is very volatile and questionable. Does he really like you? Or does he pretend to, to get something from you.</p>
<p>Now we phrase it such that the measurement is in your control:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success means people trust me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can control this by having integrity, by not lying and cheating people. People will distrust you when you lie to them over and over again. When you promise to deliver, but you fail repeatedly. Building trust is entirely in your control: you choose to break it or not.</p>
<p>A more common example would be:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success is when me and my friends communicate and hang out often</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That seems fine, but you can't control your friends schedules or availability. If they get very busy with life and work, and fail to hang out with you, would YOU have failed?</p>
<p>Here's how to phrase it better:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Success is when I'm there for my friends when they need me</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There we go, now control is entirely in your hands. If your friends need you and require your assistance, physically or emotionally, will YOU be there? Now you can truly measure success, because it's entirely contingent on your actions.</p>
<p>In short, success in all areas of life should be measured by things YOU can do. And in the event of a failure, it is entirely YOUR fault (see taking responsibility). Once you acknowledge it's YOUR fault, you can do something to change it. If it's not your fault, chances are, you can't change it. And if that's the case, don't give a f*ck will you?</p>
