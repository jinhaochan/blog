    <p>Know that this world was not made to accomodate you. Not everything will go according to your plan. Not all of your hopes will come true. Not everyone will like you.</p>
<p>Reality is truely different from how we wish it to be, and often it can be hurting. We may feel agitated, regret, and anger, but we must always remember, we were born out of the circumstances of the world, and we are subjects to these circumstances. We may try to control it and manipulate it, but in the end, we will lose.</p>
<p>The hardest part of it all is acceptance. To accept and humble ourselves that we were wrong in our views. To accept that some of our hopes can never be realized. To accept that we are wrong, and no matter how much effort we put in, we must accept that there is a possibility of it have no result. That is what we must accept. No amount of motivation or determination will allow you to achieve everything that you want. If hardwork and determination always guaranteed success, then a hardworking mule would be the king of the jungle, instead of the worthy lion.</p>
<p>We are just like 3 pin plugs, and not all sockets in the world have 3 holes. We will not be able to fit into every socket, but for those that we do, we must treasure and appreciate dearly. Not all sockets were made for us, and we were not made for all sockets. Trying forcible to fit into a 2 holed socket would only cause nothing but damage. You would never succeed.</p>
<p>I believe the greatest lie told to mankind was that you would always succeed if you put in effort. That is why we have so many people who cannot accept rejection and failure. Instead, we must teach the people that rejection is part of life, and it is only through rejection that we know our place.</p>
<p>We are creatures of failure, but it is imperative that we fail, for it is where we learn the grratest lessons from.</p>
