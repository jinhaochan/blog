  <div>
    <p>Whenever I learn new stuff, be it from reading books, to watching videos or documentaries, I always wanted to store the knowledge somewhere.</p>
<p>I'm like a horder for knowledge, and i'm always afraid of not remembering what i read or learnt.</p>
<p>At the same time, writing summaries down and blog posts sometimes feels like spam, when you have only a handful of learning points to take away. Therefore, i've repurposed one of my old websites to store this information.</p>
<p>This website was meant to be my running website, where I updated each run session I took, and hopefully long enough, I would be able to apply some analytics to it. Right now... it's dead. Just like my passion for running.</p>
<p>I've tried making a website in NodeJS, but to be honest, I did not enjoy coding in js at all. It might be because I'm already more familiar with Python, without new JS packages coming out every month telling me it's the new best way to do things.</p>
<p>This repurposed site also has many already built features, such as login, signing up, sending emails for confirmation, liking posts and much more. Therefore, I would like to continue expanding on it, adding more features.</p>
<p>Even the frontend, which is currently done with Bootstrap, is good enough.</p>
<p>That website will thus be my Knowledge Repository, where I'll write down key learning points of materials i've read.</p>
<p>This website will still be the same, but the book review part will probably be extracted out. It'll be left with ramblings, data science, and security.</p>
<p>If there's a way to put that application under this, that would be great. Else, i'll need to get another domain for that.</p>

	  <h2>Comments:</h2>
	  Contact me for any comments, and I'll paste them here! Why not Disqus or other comment services? That's because I want to have control of my site, comments included!

	  PS: I won't put your real name and email if you don't want me to.
