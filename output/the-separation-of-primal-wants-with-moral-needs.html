  <div>
    <p>Part of me connects with the universe, understanding that the human life is fleeting and insignficant, that life should never be taken so seriously, because in the end, no one remembers the trivial bickerings but your own memory, which disappears with you as you perish in this vast planet floating in the eternal abyss of cosmological darkness.</p>
<p>This cosmological connection i have makes me adopt the attitude of alturism, knowing that since my time is limited, i must be perfection, or at least try to be. I strive for knowledge and justice, for they are the eternal constants in this impermanat world. That is the Moral need that i adopt, because it is a neccesity as a living human. The world has given us life, and we must uphold its sanctity. I love everyone, because everyone suffers the same predicament as me, and not everyone is aware of it. Which brings me to my other self, the Primal wants.</p>
<p>Those who indulge in their Primal wants, materialism, mediocre media indulgence, sex and alcohol, petty menial bickerings, fail to see the Moral needs that they need to adopt. And sometimes i indulge in my Primal wants as well, because i am only human. I judge people, i get irritated, i do things of folly, i get emotionally charged and do foolish things that hurt others. And at the end of the day, when i get in touch with my other self, i feel a wave of regret. That is because the Primal wants and Moral needs currently lie in ditchotomy for me. I need to find a way to amalgamate them together as great men did. Where the causes of great men were also their Primal wants, and  not moments of motivation. That is true greatness, and that is what i, and everyone else should strive for. The Primal-Moral essence.</p>
