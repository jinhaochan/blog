My interest in religion has always been immensely vast. I've always been asking questions about the meaning of life and what happens after death, and apparently religion is the ONLY outlet that (attempts) to answer these variants of question.

I've been a Buddhist for quite some time, say around 18-20 years, but that was only by label. I did not really have any true conviction for Buddhism. And the reason I was a Buddhist was not because I found it interesting and picked it up, but rather it was forced upon me by my mother (Of which to this day I am furious about). I did learn a fair bit about Buddhism during those years. Concepts of Karma, reincarnation, the afterlife etc. But I guess you could attribute my sudden severance with the religion with a sudden onset of critical thinking. At some point in my life I think I "matured" mentally, and started realizing that life isn't all fun and games. There are real problems which will come my way sooner or later, and there are answers which I must actively seek and evaluate for myself. The road isn't paved for me, I must toil and create it.

That questioning period was probably when I started to doubt Buddhism and it's teachings. It contained many mythological aspects to it that are present in other religions which would warrant me to be an unbeliever. I saw no distinct differences between Buddhism and other religions, which troubled me deeply. How can I proclaim my religion is true which dismissing the other religions, when at the heart of it all there is nothing I can put on the table to boost my credibility. And if I can't proclaim it to be true, I will not dedicate my life to something false. I must, however, give my respects to the teachings it has taught me. The Five Precepts; No killing, No stealing, No lying, No abuse of drugs, No sexual misconduct. And also the art of meditation, which has brought about tremendous benefits to me. But aside from that, I am an atheist.

That was when I started reading books such as "Is God An Illusion" by Deepak Chopra and Leonard Mlodinow, discussing and debating about various real world issues. From there I learnt that religion still plays a very important role in today's society, and has its roots set deep into many minds of the masses, as much as I would like to ignore it from the stance of an atheist. I then went on to register for a module in my course named "Faith and Reason". It really should be named Religion and Logic based on the syllabus and the argumentative environment the course has adopted.

So while chatting with my friend Matthias, who happens to be a very staunch Christian, I show and complained to him about the absurd amount of money I forked out to buy the textbook for the module. I also showed him the other book "Is God An Illusion" to him, to which he invited me to his church. I responded politely with a 5 second video of me shaking my head (Snapchatting). After which he messaged me: "At least experience both sides of the argument.". That sentence really struck me deep, as I realized how selfish and at the same time elitist about my atheistic persuasion I was. I had to give them a chance. They had as much a conviction to God as I had to the absence of it/him/her. And so I made arrangements with him and I was due to arrive at the church on Sunday, 19/1/2014.

I was supposed to meet him 10am at Potong Pasir, and when the day came, I woke up late. I had half the mind to tell him that "I would not be able to make it", but then my inner soul made me add "in time" to the end of the excuse.
