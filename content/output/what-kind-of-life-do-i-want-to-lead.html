</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>That's a question I've began to re-ask myself. I think that over the short period my career as a Software Engineer (Or a Systems Analyst) for 2 years has changed my perceptions quite a bit.</p>
<p>Things were much more straightforward as a fresh graduate. The only thing we were worried about was employment. Which company do i want to work in, which field of work do i want to dive into, how much starting salary should i aim for such that it is a good base were all the topics of discussion. Now, those were good questions to ask, but they were good and relevant only at that point of time. However, i'm long past that phase, and those questions have duly been answered, met, or just became irrelevant and obsolete. That does not mean that i should stop asking those types of questions. Life decisions and questions of which the answers influence your actions.</p>
<p>What kind of life do i want to lead, is the question I've been asking. Now that i have a stable job and a steady flow of income, i think i can safely say that I've moved up the rungs of Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs for me to think about esteem. When i use the word "esteem" here, i'm referring to the value i see in myself, and the intrinsic value i'm able to bring to society. What sort of life do i have to lead in order for me to feel that my life is valuable? What decisions do i have to make, professions i have to engage in, or people i have to help that would give me meaning? I guess in this sense, a valuable life is a meaningful life, therefore perhaps the question i should be asking is <strong>What Gives Life Meaning?</strong></p>
<p>Here, i would like to take a quotation from a book "Man's Search for Meaning" by Viktor Frankl, where he says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What was really needed was a fundamental change in our attitude toward life. We had to learn ourselves and, furthermore, we had to teach the despairing men, that <em>it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us</em>. We needed to stop asking about the meaning of life, and instead think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life—daily and hourly. Our question must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is in direct contradiction to the question i have in mind. He seems to allude a life of passivity in decisions, where you only react to the lemons being thrown at you. While I do agree with this sort of thinking, where <em>"Our question must consists, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct."</em>, I feel that it should be augmented with another form of active thinking, and we should be doing both the passivity of reaction to life, as well as the proactive seeking to what we desire. Perhaps in his situation, the latter was not revealed to him as a choice.</p>
<p>I have previously thought of some areas of life that, amalgamated together, give rise to meaning. They were: Self, Social, Spiritual and Professional. However, i've began to think that these were only generally good guidelines on how to compartmentalize my life, but not a guideline to find meaning, or how to direct my actions towards a more fulfilling life.</p>
<p>Inherently, we are all pleasure seeking, and a very general meaning we all have is the attainment of satisfaction. Things that make us or others happy is definitely meaningful. But that's still extremely broad. What kind pleasures are we speaking about? Pleasures of mental stimulation? Pleasures of the flesh? Pleasures of social interaction? Pleasures of recognition? I guess a way to go get closer to the answer is to get further abstracted away from the original question. What gives me pleasure? That which gives me pleasure, gives me meaning. That which gives me meaning, gives me value.</p>
<p>I think I shall leave answering this question for another post. What Gives Me Pleasure?</p>
