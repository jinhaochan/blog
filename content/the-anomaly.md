Death is not an anomaly to life.

Life is an anomaly to death.

Life is the antithesis to the hundreds and millions of years of nonexistence.

A sudden spurt of existence, and all the emotions that come along with it.

Happiness and sadness. Lust and love. Compassion and scorn. Empathy and envy. Pleasure and pain.

A few years of existence, a fiesty pause to the infinite years of oblivion.

Fear not Death, for it is the natural state we all came from.

Waste not Life, for it presents a short chance of awareness.

The absence of the fear of death, and the presence of the gusto for life allows you to live it fully, to each his own definition of fullness.

The anomaly is the awareness you gain in life. The anomaly is the free will you inherited. The anomaly is the choice you are allowed.

Use them well and appreciate them. Teach others to appreciate them as well. Having to a wrong view on what little life we have is an abhorrent waste.

We all return to the natural state in the end that is nonexistence. The absence of awareness, free will and choice. That is the natural state. Seize what you have now and live life greatly.

P.s this post was inspired after I went for an operation, and was put under general anesthesia. To me, the lost of conscious thought was akin to dying, and it was the closest I felt to Death.

I was initially afraid, and asked the doctor how it would feel like. He told me it would be just like going to sleep and waking up. I guess in the context of Death, it's going to sleep and not waking up.

Within this period of anesthesia induced sleep, I felt absolutely nothing and had no recollection of what happened. I then thought, perhaps the fear of Death lies in the fear of what one would experience after life, and because no one has lived to tell the tale (pun intended), it then translates to the fear of the unknown.

My experience with general anesthesia then showed me that there is absolutely nothing. No experience, no memory, no thought, no knowledge of time. What's there to fear about nothingness? We end up fearing nothing, and to put a play on words, we should therefore fear nothing.
