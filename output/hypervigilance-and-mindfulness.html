    <p>Hypervigilance is being in a constant state of look out for potential dangers and threats. Everything in a normal day could be viewed as a potential threat, and the endless worst case scenarios play out in all their different ways.</p>
<p>Being in this state usually has a history behind it, be it PSTD, or living in constant fear for your safety as a child. As a result, this hypervigilant behavior is brought together into adulthood, where the dangers are suddenly more real and all around us. Car accidents, terrorism, a plane crash, a leaking gas pipe that engulfs everyone in flames.</p>
<p>Hypervigilance is in effect mindfulness with fear attached to it. Mindfulness is the awareness of our surrounding, and of the people around us. To be mindful is to be in a state of peacefulness. You are aware of your surroundings, and you hold no feelings towards them. But once you start being aware of everything and being afraid of the unknown dangers, it turns into hypervigilance.</p>
<p>Don't seek out unknown, or even non-existent threats. Just be aware and mindful of your surrounding. Attach no feelings to it, and you will be at peace.</p>
