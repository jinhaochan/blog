    <p>We always try to find happiness. We try to seek it, as it were an object to endeavor finding. But what if it wasn't an end goal, but a by product? What if it was like a shadow, only appearing in the absence of light, it only appears in the absence of suffering? If that were the case, then just as we need to find the light that creates the shadow, we need to find the sufferings to remove, in order to create happiness.</p>
<p>Here I would explore ideas that read, which pinpoints human suffering to the struggling definition of oneself. Who am I, and what am I here for?</p>
<p><strong><u>I am what I have</u></strong><br>
In this view, we wrongly define ourselves as our material possessions. The more we own, the more we think we are elevated in societies ranks. The pursuit of wealth and material items, which like a drug, only temporarily satiates the greed of the soul, and more importantly, it know satiates your own soul. It is a selfish and blind endeavour to pursue materials in order to seek definition of oneself.</p>
<p>You would constantly be caught in a never ending cycle of materialism, and the need to own more as old possessions lose their value. This gives rise to anxiety, something which we wish to disassociate ourselves from.</p>
<p><strong><u>I am what I do</u></strong><br>
While this definition is not as malevolent as the materialistic one, it seems to have misguided many to believe that in order to be productive, I have to be doing something, no matter what it is. We have been convinced to demonise idle time, and we're always looking for something to fill up our time with "stuff" to do. And even if we do not enjoy the things we do, we are deluded into thinking that regardless of enjoyment, the act of nonidleness is a virtue.</p>
<p>We soldier on, always looking for things to busy our mind, to distract us from the existential crisis we choose to ignore. We get lost in work, and when we snap out of it, we get a false sense of satisfaction. This gives rise to frustration. On an idle weekend, one would beat themselves up for being "unproductive". We struggle to find mindless activities to pass time, or rather, to waste time. Such a struggle is uncalled for, and doing something for the sake of doing it to feel productive is a false lie we must stop believing in.</p>
<p><strong><u>I am what I am</u></strong><br>
In the previous 2 definitions, we saw the definition of self from a materialistic perspective, and a narcissistic perspective. This final definition, and the one I believe is the most accurate one, seeks to define a person from within. Not from external powers such as owning materials and pseudo-productive activities. The ultimate aim of us all is to grow and flourish optimally, bounded within the constrains given the situation you are in. This aim should be our definition of ourselves. Do not seek to own more than you want. Do not seek to do more than you want. Own what you will. Do what you will. This is the optimal state for each of us.</p>
<p>Frustation and anxiety arises when we struggle to own more than we want,  and do more than we want. And we do so because we are wrongly defining ourselves by the first two views. We become torn out from our basic nature,  and wrongly seek validation from the outside. Return back to your innerself. Return back to your basic nature. Who are you?</p>
