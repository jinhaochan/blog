Life is but a tiny room. We can't fit a lot in it, so we have to be prudent to choose what we pick to put in the room.

I believe that technical skills, while important for one to earn his keep and prove his worth, possibly even grow a passion for, should only be considered a tradecraft. A skill to function as a useful person in society.

However, while we focus much on honing our techincal prowess, we seem to be forgetting a more paramount skill, that of morality, that of widsom, or to cite the 4 virtues, Prudence, Justice, Temperament and Courage.

What good is it that I can control my weights in the gym, but anger controls me so easily. What good is that I can get along with my boss and people at work, but I can't get along with my conscience. What good is it that people look up to me, but i'm not at peace with myself.

Work on achieving wisdom, that is life's greatest task, and one which will permeate through your entire life. If you only focus on your technical skills, your achievements will only be tied to the present. Fleeting and transient, but not to say they are not useful.

Let wisdom be what you seek primarily, while practicing your tradecrafts in idle time, instead of seeking wisdom in idle time. If you do that, you most definitely won't grow wiser, only more skillful.
