Does it motivate me?

Do I wake up dying to go to work, or rather die than go to work?

Is the process avoidable, or is there anyway I can improve it?

No. No. No.

I'm currently reading up on the tradeoffs for high-paying high-stress job, for a low-paying low-stress job.

Will I be willing to take the pay cut?

Maybe.

At the same time, i'm starting to discover myself more.

Working under deadlines, having to face multiple bosses, a dreaded 8:15 - 17:45 lifestyle (The only time I see the sun is during my lunch break). Do I enjoy this lifestyle?

Maybe not.

After hearing a respected speaker for Staff Working say this phrase: "That's where my youth went to." It makes me afraid.

I don't like it here, but will I be willing to take the jump?

This is probably my first crossroad as an adult, where I have to make a mature decision. One that will alter the course of my life.

It's one of the many crossroads I will face, and I hope I make the wise decision.

This will definitely be an experience.
