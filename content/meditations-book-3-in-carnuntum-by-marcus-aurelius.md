"Don’t waste the rest of your time here worrying about  
other people—unless it affects the common good. It will  
keep you from doing anything useful. You’ll be too  
preoccupied with what so-and-so is doing, and why, and  
what they’re saying, and what they’re thinking, and what  
they’re up to, and all the other things that throw you off and  
keep you from focusing on your own mind.  
You need to avoid certain things in your train of thought:  
everything random, everything irrelevant. And certainly  
everything self-important or malicious. You need to get used  
to winnowing your thoughts, so that if someone says, “What  
are you thinking about?” you can respond at once (and  
truthfully) that you are thinking this or thinking that. And it  
would be obvious at once from your answer that your  
thoughts were straightforward and considerate ones—the  
thoughts of an unselfish person, one unconcerned with  
pleasure and with sensual indulgence generally, with  
squabbling, with slander and envy, or anything else you’d be  
ashamed to be caught thinking."
