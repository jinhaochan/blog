    <p>After reading this book (still in progress) called Happiness by Richard Layard, it got me thinking on the subject i've been bothered for quite some time now: Why do we work?</p>
<p>Here are a few simple points i've gathered:</p>
<ol>
<li>I work to be a useful contributing member of the society. I find meaning in work that I am doing my part to ensure the proper functioning of the society I am living in.</li>
<li>I work to gain social status. As a programmer, to be labeled as one, gives me a sense of ingenuity. To feel like I am achieving something, and for personal satisfaction that the work I am engaged in is professional.</li>
<li>I work for financial stability. To survive in the world, as well as to indulge slightly in the material joys of it. But I have to be cautious not to fall into this trap of overindulgence of material goods, for they only bring about temporary satisfaction. (Much like how you treasure your new phone on the 1st week, but throwing it on the table by the 5th.)</li>
</ol>
<p>As I wrote in my previous post, work, at least where I am right now, is an intractable reality, therefore my expectations towards it should be managed.</p>
<p>I will not gain immense joy from it, but I should not be suffering.</p>
<p>I can however, approach the challenges positively, knowing that every hurdle I overcome does a few thing:</p>
<p>a) It improves the overall functioning of my company.</p>
<p>b) It allows me to learn and pick up new skills.</p>
<p>I should therefore focus on these things to gain a more positive attitude.</p>
<p>Just got an idea. I should buy a notebook (I already have so many... But this is one of the material indulgence), and write down what challenges I face everyday, and how I have overcome them, and also what I have learnt from it.</p>
