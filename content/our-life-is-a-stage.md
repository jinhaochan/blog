Our life is a stage. A play directed and acted by us and us alone. We are the main characters in our play, and all the other people in our lives are calefares. Sure, there are some really important people in your life, like family, friends and lovers. They are not main characters, but important characters that influences how you direct and act out your play. Ultimately, you are in control of everything.

Holding that view, we must almost understand that everyone else has their own stages, and in their stage and play, *YOU *are the calefare. You may be an important character in some people's play, or you may be a fleeting character, that comes and goes as quick as the wind. It is necessary to understand this, as it gives us a deeper understanding of how and why others act differently, and it is simply because they are in their stage, and you are in yours. Different directors, different settings, different scenarios. Other times, it may also be the *other* person who is confused by your actions, and you must know that perhaps it is because *he* is not in your stage, and therefore you cannot assume he knows the reasons for your actions in entirety.

In some cases, as lovers or with people you really care about, you may want to enter their stage as a main character. You may wish to want to stay longer in their stage and act out the important parts in their play. But it is ultimately *their* stage, and some people will let you stay, while others will not, and you *MUST* accept their decision, because it is not your stage! We may think and reminisce about the play, just like how we think about a movie we have just watched. But in the end we must move on to our own stage. It is therefore empowering to know that *YOU *have that exact same power in your stage. Remove the bad actors! Remove the naysayers! Remove the hecklers! Leave behind only those who appreciate your play.

Our live should therefore be aimed towards perfecting our play. Making our show as interesting as possible. As lively as possible. The more interesting your show is, the more people will come to watch it. We must focus on our stage, and do our best to create the best scenes. Do not criticize other people's stage. Do not destroy other people's stage, Do not be so bothered in other people's stage that you neglect your own. Tend to your play, because when the curtains fall, people will throw flowers at it, and the curtains will never open again.
