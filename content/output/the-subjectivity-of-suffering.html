</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>So i wrote a piece for one of my friend. Initally it had some religious context, but then we spoke about something more general on Suffering:</p>
<p>How do we come to conclude that a certain event, or despairing predicament a person is in amounts to suffering?</p>
<p>We know that we are suffering if we feel a certain amount of personal discomfort. The Sun is beating down on your exposed skin. Your legs weary from standing. Your heart aches from a sour relationship. Your stomach growls in emptiness.</p>
<p>We know for certain when we experience suffering, with our own subjective intangible metrics. Certain lines we cross that our mind tells us “Stop!”. And this threshold changes and varies with so many external factors. Your boss compared to your friend. 8 hours of sleep compared to 3 hours of sleep. An empty stomach compared to a ravanous one.</p>
<p>Even to ourselves, for which we supposedly know best, cannot concretely define our own suffering, how then do we know for certain if another person is in a state of suffering?</p>
<p>We see a person in a wheelchair, a disabled person with no arms or even a person without a home, and we immediately think of them as suffering.</p>
<p>But are they really suffering subjectively? Or do we assume that they are suffering because they do not fit into our ideal visions of happiness?</p>
<p>“He must be suffering because he is in a wheelchair, and is unable to walk and run.”</p>
<p>“She must be suffering because she has no home and family to live with”</p>
<p>Here, we project our beliefs of happiness onto them, and if they do not match any of them, we instinctively think that they are suffering.</p>
<p>Is a man with no arms suffering, if he has become at peace with it, and lives his life to the fullest?</p>
<p>What about a man with two functional arms, but with a troubled mind that wears him down everyday?</p>
<p>And because we do not see the troubled mind, we have no projections of suffering, and we do not emphatize as much. That is the neglect depression suffers endure.</p>
<p>This projection ultimately originates from ourselves. How we define how happiness should be achieved influences how much suffering we see other people have.</p>
<p>A simple man sees a simple world, with happiness defined simply. He thus sees less suffering, because the simplest of events matches his views of attaining peace. Being able to eat a meal. Having a shelter over your head. Having a friend.</p>
<p>A demanding man demands much from the world, with happiness defined complexly. He sees the most suffering, because it is so hard for him to be happy, and no one else should be. You must have a car. You must be earning a certain amount of income.</p>
<p>I am not saying that there is no suffering. War, famine and death are very real sufferings.</p>
<p>True sufferings are the ones that we can all relate to.</p>
<p>Projected sufferings are the ones that don’t fit to our vision.</p>
<p>That being said, true sufferings or projected sufferings, we must strive to eliminate or at least mitigate them.</p>
