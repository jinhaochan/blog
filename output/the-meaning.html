    <p>What is the meaning of life? Big question, and I approach this knowing that I can never find the answer. It is however, not the end that matters, but the means. The thought process. If I cannot find out what life is, at least I can deduce what life is not by thinking about it.</p>
<p>First, let us define what is meaning when we attempt to use it to describe life:</p>
<p>[The Meaning of Meaning]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>When we say that something as meaning, we can refer to two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>A Description.</li>
<li>A Significance.</li>
</ol>
<p>Meaning, when used as a description, simply describes an action, a word or anything that requires inference. His actions of banging the table <strong>means</strong> he is angry. His tone of saying this word <strong>means </strong>he is sarcastic. The way he dresses <strong>means </strong>he is an outgoing purpose</p>
<p>But when we refer to meaning as a significance, we are not describing anything, but ascribing something to it. Ascription, is defined as</p>
<blockquote>
<p>* to refer to a supposed cause, source, or author*</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ascribe">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ascribe</a></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is to say, when we ask what is the meaning of life, we ascribe a significance to it, and that significance is the supposed cause of life. The supposed cause of why we are here.</p>
<p>Now that we have defined what we mean by meaning, let us proceed.</p>
<p>[Is the meaning of life to seek pleasure?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>Humans instinctively seeks pleasure. We are pleasure driven, and want to feel good. Pleasurable food, pleasurable company, pleasurable work. But is the meaning to life just to seek out pleasure? Are we driven solely to seek pleasure? To me, this way of thinking sounds like we are holding too low of a standard to ourselves. Being pleasure driven limits our actions and thoughts to only a select few. Some actions are not pleasurable, but reaps enormous benefits. We must do those too.</p>
<p>Having only to seek pleasure seems a little selfish too, that all our actions should be guided towards making ourselves happy. It seems to imply the absence of consideration for others, because if we do, there would definitely be some degree of compromise involved on our personal pleasures.</p>
<p>Is this the supposed cause of life? That we are here just to feel good and then pass on? It may fit the bill for some people, but not for me.</p>
<ul>
<li>Pleasure: Too low a standard. Too selfish.</li>
</ul>
<p>[Is the meaning of life to service about others?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>This can be a valid meaning for some, but not to me. It requires you to hold a great deal of altruism, so much in fact that you are willing to forgo all of your needs to service others. I find that only religious people can lie in this category, because their goal is driven towards a divine unworldly being, and hence they are willing to forsake all that is earthly in return for Salvation.</p>
<p>Can an atheist or a non-believer do the same? To give up all of his belongings, his career and his wants to be of service to others. I do not think so, as the non-religious are bounded by the tangible. Without any promise of reward to give up their earthly belongings and personal goals, one would not be enticed to do so.</p>
<p>That does not mean that the non-religious cannot love as much as the religious. Both parties can love another person to the same degree, but both take different actions to express their love. Both would dedicate their lives to the service of others, but the non-religious would still hold on to his part, while the religious has already given up that part to their God.</p>
<p>This seems like a good meaning to life. That we are here to help and assist others. It does not matter the degree of altruism, as long as we have it in mind. But to me, this does not seem significant enough to be my meaning to life. I cannot find myself dedicating a big part of my life and giving up all that I have to the service of others (Sorry, i'm just not that altruistic). Sure, I do give and contribute to society, but it is not a big part of me attribute this as the significance and meaning of my life.</p>
<ul>
<li>Service to others: Good and valid meaning, just not mine</li>
</ul>
<p>[Is the meaning to life about reproduction?]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>The underlying biology in our genes drives us to find the perfect conditions to procreation and spreading life. However, we are lucky enough to be in a era (and country) where our basic needs of security is met. We have shelter, food, water, and all other basic necessities such that survival is not an immediate concern.</p>
<p>In the absence of this constant threat of dying, we put our mental capabilities to good use and think in the abstract. Those whose basic necessities are already met, but still tirelessly seek them out are working to gain excess. The gluttonous and the materialist. They do not make use of the capabilities of their minds to give (ideas, abstraction), but are caught in the constant pleasures of what is already given (food, company).</p>
<ul>
<li>Reproduction: Conditions for reproduction are not a dire threat. Therefore no significance is gained in pursuing it</li>
</ul>
<p>[The the meaning to life about knowledge]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>I guess this is the only meaning that I find most appealing.</p>
<p>Of all the living things on the earth, we have the most powerful brain. Why shouldn't we use it? An alligator uses its strong jaws for hunting. The lion uses its lethal fangs for the kill. The bird uses its wings to fly. Yet humans, for all its physical deficiencies in murderous Savannah, triumphs because of the brain.</p>
<p>I wont go into detail the wondrous things the brain can do. It has helped us survive, and even more, thrive. One of the ways to train the brain and make use of its full potential is to gain knowledge. Technical knowledge (IT skills), Social knowledge (E.Q), General knowledge (I.Q), Moral knowledge (Beliefs), Spiritual knowledge (Religion) and many more. The key is to learn, and apply critical thinking onto the lessons learnt.</p>
<p>Of course, not everything can be known, and not everything can be understand by rationality. The thirst for knowledge is like a hungry man. Inquire too much, and you would never be full. Inquire nothing, and you would starve. Inquiring in the right amount, and putting faith in the unanswerable, keeps you fill.</p>
<p>This, amalgamated with the significance of service to others, can be the meaning of life, and also lead to a meaningful life*.</p>
<p>To learn, To serve.</p>
<p><em>Discere Servire</em></p>
<p>* "Can be the meaning of life" is different from "Lead to a meaningful life". The former puts meaning in precedence, that we were placed here to fulfill the significance. The latter describes meaning as an emergent ascription, that is to say that life inherently has no meaning, but what we do gives it meaning. I believe that if we conclude the meaning to be both the prior and the posterior, we have found true meaning. I don't imagine this to be an easy task. Some find the prior without the posterior (A religious person who is stuck in a corporate job), and others, a posterior without the prior (A person who loves his job, but wonders if there is something greater). I am in the latter group, and I do know of a few people in the former group.</p>
