    <p>Okay, i think i'm gonna update my blog more often now. And by more often i mean at least once a month. I find i always have all these thoughts in my mind that makes me question many things, but after i get home and play a few rounds of DOTA, i instantly forget them.</p>
<p>Without further ado, the topic i thought about today while cycling was the concept of I. Me. Self. So i within my own reasoning and thought process, i came up with this high level abstraction:</p>
<p><img alt="Capture" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-155" height="462" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/capture.png" width="654"></p>
<p>So we have the overarching "I", which is just a word thrown around in conversations.</p>
<p>It then splits down into two "I"s, the "I" in relation to others, and the "I" in relation to self.</p>
<p>[<strong>"I" in relation to others</strong>]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</p>
<p>When a tree falls in the forest, and nobody hears it fall, does it make a sound?</p>
<p>I'm going to give my own answer here and say: No. (Spare me the philosophical arguments, i'm making another point here)</p>
<p>So why doesn't it make a sound? Because no one is there to observe it fall. No one is there to internalize the vision and the sound of a falling tree. No one <strong>experiences</strong> it. And i think that's the crux of the issue, the human experience of things that makes things "exists"</p>
<p>Now, if a human lives on earth, and it impact no one at all, does it still exist?</p>
<p>Again from my own argument:No! It may be a living thing going about its daily life, but if it doesn't impact others, and doesn't create <strong>positive experiences </strong>for others, then it's existence is insignificant. Note that i emphasized on positive, for if it were negative, people would wish we never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>With this argument, i'm <strong>not</strong> saying that unless we make an incredibly huge impact like Bill Gates or Ghandi, we're non-existent. As long as we impact the people around us in our daily lives in a positive way, we are existing wholly and fully. As long as we always create positive experiences for others, we will forever exist in the impermanence of their memories, no matter the fate of our physical bodies. Here's a nice post written by Frank Yang on our own self value on our own life.</p>

<p>This is how the "I" in relation to others arises to existence. Through our deeds and actions that impact them. Our birth is significant, because of what lies ahead of us. Our death is significant, because of what lies behind us.</p>
<p><strong>[The "I" in relation to self]{style="text-decoration:underline;"}</strong></p>
<p>The "I" in relation to self splits off into two areas: the "I", and the self. Is there a difference? From what i thought of, yes.</p>
<p>The "I" that we hold to ourselves the inner self that we use to interact with the outerworld. "I" am feeling hungry. "I" am feeling tired. "I" am feeling stressed. This "I" is highly reactive to the surroundings, and is very primitive.</p>
<p>The Self however, is something deeper. It's where your morals and values reside. These things are less reactive, and are likely to stay the same regardless of the environment.</p>
<p>Our focus should therefore lie on the Self, and not the malleable "I". We have to build our inner foundation and strengthen it to live as a person with morals.</p>
<p>At times we act on the "I", which receives inputs from the external world, and this causes a conflict with our Self. Therein arises guilt and remorse. As the saying goes</p>
<p><img alt="check" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-196" height="473" src="https://jayhayche.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/check.jpg" width="625"></p>
<p>"Check your<strong>SELF"</strong>. Which means before you act on the highly reactive "I", you need to take a step back and understand that the "I" is dynamic. Check on your Self. Does it conflict with the inner Self?</p>
<p>That said, the "I" is not all bad. I think this "I" could represent the gut feeling, which is sometimes a good thing to act upon.</p>
<p>Alright that's all the arguments and theories I thought about today. Until the next time i start thinking about stuff again.</p>
