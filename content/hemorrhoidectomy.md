Ive always had trouble spelling that word, but after going through it last Sunday (10th April), i've been searching up and reading about it so much, especially the recovery period.

I'm writing this posts now, because i've been inspired by all other posts by people who have gone through hemorrhoidectomy, and the tips they provide. I feel like i'm passing the flame down. Also, for people suffering hemorrhoids in silence, please do not feel shy about it, and consult a doctor if it starts bleeding.

I've been suffering from hemorrhoids for quite awhile now, probably about close to a year. It was one small tiny hemorrhoid that prolapsed whenever i took a dump, but it never really bothered me at all. Every time i wiped my butt, there was blood, but i took it as nothing, and simply pushed the piles back in.

Until one day, it started to bleed really badly. Blood was dripping non-stop, and the entire toilet bowl was filled with blood. When i stood up, blood was dripping my butt. Obviously this prompted me to go to a hospital (Parkway East) to visit a doctor (Dr Imran Nawaz) immediately, and a surgery was schedule the following day.

Doctor told me not to consume any food, and only to drink clear liquid. I was set to do a colonoscopy, and aÂ ***HEMORRHOIDECTOMY.*** Those words still scare me. I was given a bottle of "Fleet" to drink, which was oral sodium phosphate. Basically, it drains water from your body, and flushes the colon out clean.

Worst. Night. Ever.

Every 20 mins, i was rushing to the toilet to let out jets of water out from my butt. I could hardly catch any sleep, even up till 4am. At 5:30am, a nurse came in to give me another half dosage. My surgery was scheduled to be at 9:00am.

I was pretty calm about it. Joking and jesting with the nurses who brought me in to the surgery room (Su, Joseph and Al). It all happened to fast. I was given anesthesia, and fell straight to sleep, and the operation was performed

I woke up at about 1030am, and was still a little drowsy from the drugs. I was repeating whatever i heard from the nurses, and mimicking them. I was also telling jokes to the nurses, probably disturbing them working. Kinda embarrassing come to think of it!

I was to stay in the hospital for one more night for the nurses and doctor to check my wound, in case there was any sudden bleeding, or if i felt unwell. I was promptly discharged the next day.

I can say i've never ever felt so much pain and discomfort in my life. I never knew this sort of pain was possible to a human. (Okay a little exaggerated.) Every time i had to poop, i was sweating, and my toes were clenched. I would be gritting my teeth and grabbing the walls because of the immense pain. Horrible horrible experience.

After every poop i had to take a warm bath to calm myself down, and i also had to take a sitz bath, which really helped a lot with the swelling.

I was constipated once, and it was so bad. Note to readers: Do not get constipated. Ever.

Its day 8 now as of writing this post. The pain has subsided immensely, and i can finally see the light of getting healed. Im starting to do light workouts such as squats and pull ups. I can finally sit up to get out of bed, instead of tumbling and rolling over. I can finally poop without feeling im going to faint from the pain.

My follow up appointment is on next Monday, and i'm really eager to see how much i've healed by then!
