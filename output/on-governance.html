    <p>The more incessant the denigration of government and duty, the quicker the domino pieces would fall, with the last and cardinal piece being the very defense of the nation.</p>
<p>Pillars such as economics and social stability will be shaken in the absence of national identity, when you start hearing people saying they would not fight for their own country. Even if the threat of conventional war is minimal in this day and age, the nation must have a certain level of conviction and pride in their own land they were born in. Your parents brought you to the world, and we are grateful for them. So why is it that we are not grateful for the country that brought us up?</p>
<p>There is already a substantial amount of hate and anger from the population towards the leaders of this country. We nitpick on trivial issues, shooting the government down at every opportunity we can. Train break downs, fare hikes and other matters that hinder us only slightly are the loudest talking points for the population.</p>
<p>When most of the people scoff at government sector jobs, mocking it as lacking ambition. When people don't understand the notion of purpose towards an ideal, and everything they work on is for personal gain. When people seek not what they can do for the society, but is constantly complaining about and criticizing the system. That is when society begins to become unstable.</p>
<p>There is constant comparison to the western ideas, and the western policies. I would say that those policies and ideas were made for a liberal country and for liberal minded people. And i would also go another step to say that Singapore is not entirely liberal, but pseudo-liberal. Those policies and ideas would not be effective here.</p>
<p>What is missing from us is national pride. How many of us hang the national flag outside our houses on national day? How many of us are able to recite the national anthem? How many of us are truly concerned about the defense of the nation? Most of us are not even remotely proud about our country, and they view Singapore as a stepping stone to a bigger global stage. What this leaves is with is a population looking away from Singapore, even though they are in it.</p>
<p>It is therefore the duty of the government to instill a national pride into the people. To create a place that we are proud of, and that we want to show off. To move away from the profit making agendas and discover more of the peoples wants and needs. But all of that is not possible only from one side. It takes two hands to clap, and actions from the government alone will not change the society, because the government IS the society. We cannot wrongly view the government as at the top of the ladder, and that all the actions trickle down in a diminishing fashion to the people. That dichotomic view of governance is wrong. The government is not in charge of the people, but they are supposed to be a representative of the people, which leads us to a sad case when the people themselves have no faith in the government, and what is reflected are faithless policies. When the people are greedy and selfish and hateful. When we bicker on unintelligent issues, least to say in an unintelligent way. The people in power are the very same people you sit beside the train. The only difference is our job scope, and maybe much about the pay controversially so.</p>
<p>That is to say, to even speak of changing the way the government is running, we have to change ourselves first. We have to change our expectations, our selfish way of thinking only about profitability, our bickering about ridiculously trivial things. The people gets the government they deserve. In a corrupted country, you get a corrupted government. In a liberal country, you get a liberal government. And in a money minded country, you get a money minded government. Its is never the case where it is the other way around, where a corrupt government creates a corrupt country. Corrupted officials in Singapore are promptly removed, and that is commendable. It shows that they do not influence the general population to their believes. The only other time this was done was by a man named Adolf Hitler, but even in his case, the people already held steadfast believes that were in tune with his.</p>
<p>Therefore, to see a change in the government, we have to change ourselves. If we bring in a government with the perfect ideals, but it conflicts with ours, we would not accept him, and that ultimately defeats the purpose.</p>
