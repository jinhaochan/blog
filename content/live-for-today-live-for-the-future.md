There is no point in living in the future, if you're not living for today.

We've been sold a belief that there is some goal in the future that we must toil for today.

We've been told to plan and envision where we want to be in the future.

So much emphasis has been placed on something that is just as intangible as the past.

And when, we finally reach the "future" we've planned for, that's not the end! There is still a next set of futures, and next set of futures, until there comes a day where we must plan our death.

With this emphasis on the future, we are never really "there", but instead, placed through phases of life that are out of sync, which are always one frame in front of the present.

Planning for the future is important, but how are you to plan for whats ahead, if you don't know what you have now!

What point is there to read a map, if your current coordinates are a blur.

Live for today! Live for the present!

The future is but a fantasy, a malleable entity shaped by your choices. Choices that you make in the present.

Instead of frolicking in the future that never seems to come, seize the present, and in it you have the power to make choices to shape the future.

How do you live for the present?

Simply be aware of the present.

The people.

Your words.

Your thoughts.

Your desires.

Your surroundings.

Immerse yourself into these immediate entities, and soak in the present.

These things will never be experienced in the fantasy of the future, but only now.
