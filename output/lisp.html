    <p>Lisp is the second oldest high level programming language after Fortran. Invented in 1958, it has since then produced many dialects, such as Common Lisp, NIL (New Implementation Language), and Clojure - which is what this learning series is going to pivot to.</p>
<p>The features of Lisp that make it so powerful are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Machine Independent</li>
<li>Allows updating of programs dynamically</li>
<li>Homiconicity - lets expand on that</li>
</ol>
<h2>Homoiconicity</h2>
<p>Homoiconicity is the feature in that both the internal and external representations of a programming language are the same.</p>
<p>What the heck does that even mean?</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a non-homoiconic language: Java</p>
<p>The external representation of Java is well, the Java programming language itself, with all it's syntax and structure. The internal representation, however, is not at all the same as the external representation. The Java program is compiled down to Java bytecode before being executed. The parser first has to process the Java source code to produce an Abstract Syntax Tree, which is then compiled down to Java bytecode. The resulting AST generated from parsing the Java code is not the same as the Java source code itself. To make Java homoiconic, the syntax of Java will have to change to that of the AST, and we need to be able to code out the AST representation of Java programs.</p>
<p>So what does homoiconicity in a Lisp-dialect language look like? Let's take Clojure as an example</p>
<p>Clojure language is written in primitive data types, which means your code is data, and data is your code: both internal and external representation are the same. The code is written in lists, symbols, vectors and other Lisp data types. When the Clojure code is parsed, the resulting AST looks exactly the same as the source code.</p>
<p>TLDR: <code>if (resulting_ AST == source_code) : is_homoiconic = True</code></p>
<p>This means your output of an Eval phase can be an input to another Eval phase, and there will be no errors.</p>
<h2>So why is Homoiconic and powerful?</h2>
<p>Because the Lisp syntax allows you code out an AST directly, this allows your program to modify itself at run time, something called Meta-Programming, or Code Hot Swapping. The program can examine information and state about itself, and make modifications to them at run time, which means you can make decisions in run time.</p>
<p>One way to do metaprogramming is via Macros, which are programs that write more programs</p>
<p>The S-Expression syntax, or sexpr, which is what Lisp languages use, allows you to write code in the form of an AST. Note that the sexpr is not DIRECTLY the AST, but a very close approximation, or even identical to the resultant AST.</p>
<h2>Pivoting to Clojure</h2>
<p>For the initial few days, Iwa  reading and exploring different technologies. While this was insightful and I learnt plenty of things, I found myself rather scattered in my learning process. What do i learn next? Does it have to be linked together? It's like i'm investing my time into many different areas, but not focusing on one.</p>
<p>Therefore, what i'm going to do here on now till the end of the month, which leaves me 22 days, is to focus my daily learning into picking up Clojure. And the challenge for myself is to write a fully functional program by the end of the month that is not part of the learning process (i.e. tutorial programs do not count)</p>
